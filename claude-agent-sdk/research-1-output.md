## Methodology Notes

### Revenue Estimation Approach

Revenue estimates were derived using the following methodology:

1. **Sales-based estimates (1993-2008)**: For early titles where specific revenue data is unavailable, estimates are based on known copies sold multiplied by average retail price ($40-60), adjusted for platform mix and regional pricing.

2. **Ampere Analysis benchmark (2009-2020)**: The key data point that FIFA generated ~$500M in FY2010 growing to $2B+ by FY2020 was used to calibrate annual estimates, assuming steady growth with accelerations tied to FUT adoption.

3. **EA financial reports (2016-2025)**: For recent titles, estimates incorporate EA's publicly reported Ultimate Team revenue ($1.62B FY2021, $1.71B FY2024) plus base game sales revenue.

4. **Spin-off estimates**: FIFA Street, Manager, Online, and Mobile titles were estimated based on their niche market positioning relative to the main series.

### Confidence Ratings

- **High**: Direct EA financial disclosure or confirmed sales figures
- **Medium**: Derived from VGChartz data, EA earnings calls, or industry analyst reports with reasonable extrapolation
- **Low**: Estimated based on market context, series trajectory, and comparable title performance with significant uncertainty

### Limitations

- Individual title revenue data is not publicly reported by EA; most figures are estimates
- Early titles (1993-2005) have very limited public sales data
- FIFA Online and FIFA Mobile revenue is particularly difficult to isolate from EA's consolidated reporting
- FC 26 revenue is a partial-year estimate as of the research date
