# Reddit Research Data: FIFA / EA Sports FC Games (2023-2025) - Copy Sales

**Research Agent Iteration:** 15
**Franchise:** FIFA / EA Sports FC
**Year Range:** 2023-2025
**Date Collected:** 2026-02-20

---

## IMPORTANT CONTEXT

- EA rebranded FIFA to "EA Sports FC" starting with EA Sports FC 24 (released September 2023).
- Games in scope: EA Sports FC 24 (2023), EA Sports FC 25 (2024), EA Sports FC 26 (2025).
- "Players" reported by EA includes EA Play trial users, free weekends, and demo players -- these are NOT the same as copies sold.
- The FIFA/FC franchise historically sells 6-15 million copies per annual title, far below reported "player" counts.
- We need COPY SALES data (physical + digital), NOT player counts, NOT microtransaction revenue.

  - EA had only forecasted 3 million "players" for Dragon Age -- even that was missed by ~50%
- **Key Comments (with scores):**
  - "EA always had big internal expectations so a fact they only forecasted 3 million 'players' during initial sales window for AAA Dragon Age RPG that was in development for such a long time means even they had tempered expectations by default... Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription so while not significant % of people played using EA Play and GFNOW those still make up some chunk of 'players'" (score: 249) -- CRITICAL: Redditor explains "players" vs "copies sold" issue

  - "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual. Like the last 2 releases had the new anticheat that has been buggy as shit, they still are charging the full price even though they haven't added anything of value really in the last few releases" (score: 188)
  - "Surprise the FIFA game is doing badly, don't know if it's the name change or FINALLY people got tired of it?" (score: 161)

  - This is a notable decline signal for the FC franchise in Europe, historically one of its strongest markets
  - Data is "purely premium sales" (GSD data), not including Game Pass
- **Key Comments (with scores):**
  - "'There are a few caveats. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was included in Xbox Game Pass, which means it's likely Call of Duty had a far higher player count than Battlefield 6. This GSD data is purely premium sales.'" (score: 244) -- Important context about data type

- **Subreddit:** r/gaming | **Score:** 3,552 | **Comments:** 750 | **Date:** Dec 2025
- **Key Data Points:**
  - FIFA franchise listed among top-selling franchises of all time (infographic)
- **Key Comment (with score):**

It's still the same studio, making the same game, but not paying a licence fee to have the FIFA name (who literally provide nothing else to the game)" (score: 271) -- Confirms the naming continuity issue

### POST 15: "Best selling game of the year in the US for the past 2 decades"
- **Subreddit:** r/gaming | **Score:** 7,854 | **Comments:** 1,556 | **Date:** June 2025
- **Source:** NPD Market Research (now Circana) data
- **Key Data Points:**

- **URL:** https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/uk-physical-sales-for-ea-fc-are-down-30-compared-to-fifa-23/
- **Key Data Points:**
  - EA FC 24 UK physical sales were down 30% compared to FIFA 23
  - Physical sales only -- digital sales not tracked in this report
- **Key Comments (with scores):**
  - "Just for numbers sake: EA is 80% digital across console platforms according to their financial reports. Digital growth is around 5 percentage points per year. So if last year they sold 20% of FIFA physically that means they sold 15% this year. Just from that effect alone it would be expected for physical sales to be 25% less than last year. It's at 30% instead. So it sells pretty well." (score: 6) -- IMPORTANT: Redditor calculates that the 30% drop in physical is mostly explained by the digital shift, suggesting overall FC 24 sales were only modestly down from FIFA 23.
  - "I work at Tesco, we have actually stopped physical game sales in the last year." (score: 224)
  - "But what are the overall sales? I would expect physical to be down YoY as that media is declining." (score: 202)

- **Key Data Points:**
  - EA has a pattern of refusing to disclose specific unit sales when games underperform
  - "Battlefield is less than 10% of our portfolio so not sure what you'll do with those numbers"

- **Subreddit:** r/pcgaming | **Score:** 2,110 | **Comments:** 324 | **Date:** May 2022

  - This means copy sales are the minority of the FC franchise's revenue contribution

### POST 22: "EAFC 26 ALREADY 20%/25% OFF"
- **Subreddit:** r/EASportsFC | **Score:** 249 | **Comments:** 146 | **Date:** Oct 2025
- **Key Data Points:**
  - EA FC 26 was already discounted 20-25% within weeks of release
  - Aggressive discounting suggests underperformance or strategy to boost unit sales
- **Key Comments:**
  - "It'll be half-price by the time Black Friday comes." (score: 372) -- CONFIRMED by Post 9 above
  - "Still high, i will wait for some 40%/50% on BF or christmas to buy it." (score: 38)

### POST 23: "Thank you EA sports and FC 25 for changing my life" (satirical)
- **Subreddit:** r/EASportsFC | **Score:** 1,335 | **Comments:** 105 | **Date:** June 2025
- **Key Data Points:**
  - Satirical post about FC 25 being so bad it caused the poster to give up caring about the franchise
  - Score of 1,335 with 97% upvote ratio indicates strong community agreement
  - Reflects the depth of consumer dissatisfaction

### POST 24: "Circana September 2025: Borderlands 4 generated the highest launch month dollar sales..."
- **Subreddit:** r/Games | **Score:** 457 | **Comments:** 400 | **Date:** Oct 2025
- **Key Data Points:**
  - Circana tracks US game sales including EA FC
  - FC 26 launched in September 2025 but was NOT mentioned as the top seller -- Borderlands 4 was
  - This suggests FC 26 did not top the US monthly chart in its launch month, which is notable

## STEP 4: Per-Game Copy Sales Summary

### EA SPORTS FC 24 (Released September 29, 2023)

**Copies Sold Figures Found on Reddit:**
- **No specific global copy sales figure found on Reddit.**
- UK physical sales were down 30% vs FIFA 23 (source: VGC article discussed on r/XboxSeriesX, Oct 2023)
- Redditor analysis: EA is ~80% digital on consoles; the 30% physical drop is mostly explained by digital transition, meaning overall FC 24 sales were likely only modestly down from FIFA 23 (estimated ~5% net decline when accounting for digital shift)
- EA reported FC 24 as performing in line with expectations during FY24 earnings (no specific copy count cited on Reddit)
- FC 24 was given away on PlayStation Plus in May 2024 (~7 months after launch), which is normal timing for the franchise
- EA removed all previous FIFA games from Steam when FC 24 launched, funneling players to the new title
- Historical context: FIFA 23 reportedly had over 10 million copies sold in its first week (per various industry reports discussed on Reddit). FIFA franchise historically sells 10-15 million copies per annual title.

**Reddit Consensus on FC 24 Sales:**
- FC 24 was seen as a solid performer at the time, though with some concern about the rebrand from FIFA
- No major "underperformance" narrative emerged for FC 24 the way it did for FC 25
- The name change from FIFA to EA Sports FC caused some confusion and a drop in casual buyer recognition
- Being available on EA Play (10-hour trial) inflated "player" counts significantly beyond copy sales

**Estimated Copy Sales (based on Reddit discussion context):**
- No precise figure cited on Reddit
- Based on historical context and absence of underperformance reporting: likely in the range of 7-12 million copies (physical + digital lifetime), though no Reddit source directly confirms a number

---

### EA SPORTS FC 25 (Released September 27, 2024)

**Copies Sold Figures Found on Reddit:**
- **No specific global copy sales figure found on Reddit.**
- EA slashed fiscal year forecast due to FC 25 underperformance (Jan 2025, Bloomberg/Jason Schreier)
- EA lost $6 billion in market value partly due to FC 25 underperformance (Jan 2025, VGC)
- EA Q3 FY25 revenue fell to $1.88B from $1.94B YoY, with weakness in "soccer" cited (Feb 2025, Hollywood Reporter)
- Bloomberg: "EA says bookings slid on weakness in soccer, Dragon Age games" (Jan 2025)
- FC 25 was 50% off just 7 weeks after launch (mid-November 2024) -- much faster discounting than prior years
- FC 25 came to Game Pass/EA Play in June 2025 (~8.5 months post-launch)
- FC 25 sold 905K copies on PlayStation in June 2025 alone (at steep discount) -- suggests ongoing sales but at much lower prices
- FC 25 was the worst user-rated game in franchise history on Metacritic, Google, and Steam
- FC 25 was NOT in the US Top 20 best sellers for February 2025 (Circana data) -- dropped off quickly
- FC 25 was #1 in Europe for H1 2025 (VGChartz data) -- despite "underperforming," still topped European charts due to franchise dominance in that region
- FC 25 was top 3 in ALL 17 tracked European countries for H1 2025

**Reddit Consensus on FC 25 Sales:**
- Universally described as a commercial disappointment on Reddit
- Multiple high-upvoted posts about its underperformance
- Comments consistently point to declining quality, buggy gameplay, and consumer fatigue
- EA's own earnings confirmed "weakness in soccer" revenue
- The term "players" vs "copies sold" distinction was repeatedly highlighted by Redditors
- Despite underperformance narrative, FC 25 still topped European charts -- shows franchise's massive baseline
- "Almost like hitting them where it hurts more (money) forces company to change" (score: 333)

**Estimated Copy Sales (based on Reddit discussion context):**
- No precise figure cited on Reddit
- Given the underperformance narrative, significant discounting, and revenue decline: likely lower than FC 24, possibly in the range of 5-8 million copies (physical + digital lifetime)
- Important: EA never publicly disclosed a specific copy sales number for FC 25 on any Reddit-discussed source
- Despite underperformance relative to expectations, the game still sold millions based on European chart dominance and 905K PS copies in a single discounted month

---

### EA SPORTS FC 26 (Released September/October 2025)

**Copies Sold Figures Found on Reddit:**
- **No specific global copy sales figure found on Reddit** (game is still relatively recent as of Feb 2026)
- FC 26 debuted at #1 on European sales charts (GSD data, Oct 2025)
- FC 26 held #1 for at least 3 weeks in European charts
- FC 26 sales dropped 62% week-on-week in its third week in Europe
- Ghost of Yotei beat FC 26 in UK physical sales (Oct 2025)
- Battlefield 6 beat FC 26 European launch sales (Oct 2025, GSD premium sales data) -- a significant negative signal
- FC 26 was already 20-25% off within weeks of launch
- FC 26 was 50% off by Black Friday 2025 (less than 3 months after release)
- FC 26 was NOT the #1 US seller in September 2025 (Borderlands 4 was, per Circana)
- FC 26 was among top sellers during Europe's Black Friday 2025 (at 50% off)
- FC 26 Twitch viewership at launch was significantly lower than FC 25 and FC 24 launches
- FC 26 had severe PC input delay issues at launch (r/EASportsFC mega-thread, 730 score)
- EA was acquired for $55 billion during FC 26's lifecycle (Sept 2025)

**Reddit Consensus on FC 26 Sales:**
- Less discussion about FC 26 sales specifically than FC 25's underperformance
- Being beaten by Battlefield 6 and Ghost of Yotei in European markets is notable -- historically, FIFA/FC dominated European sales charts
- Early discounting pattern continued from FC 25 (50% off within 3 months)
- Community sentiment remains negative about the franchise's quality, though FC 26 was seen as an improvement over FC 25
- PC technical issues at launch may have dampened sales

**Estimated Copy Sales (based on Reddit discussion context):**
- No precise figure cited on Reddit
- Too early for definitive lifetime figures as of Feb 2026
- Launch signals (beaten by BF6 in Europe, early discounting, not #1 in US at launch) suggest continued weakness
- Still topped European charts for multiple weeks despite competition

## Additional Context from Reddit

### EA Revenue Structure (from Reddit discussions)
- 71% of EA's revenue comes from live service games (2022 earnings call, r/pcgaming, score: 2,110)
- EA Sports FC/FIFA Ultimate Team is the single largest revenue driver for EA
- Most FIFA/FC revenue comes from microtransactions (FIFA Points / FC Points), NOT from copy sales
- Copy sales represent a small fraction of the franchise's total revenue but are important for growing the user base that then spends on microtransactions
- EA was valued at $55 billion in its acquisition by PIF/Silver Lake (2025), reflecting the enormous value of its live-service portfolio

### EA's Pattern of Non-Disclosure (from Reddit discussions)
- EA has historically refused to give specific unit sales figures when games underperform (see: Battlefield 2042 refusing to disclose numbers, r/pcgaming, score: 4,544)
- EA reports "players" (including trials, free weekends, demos) rather than "copies sold"
- EA reports "net bookings" (which combines copy sales revenue with microtransaction revenue) making it impossible to isolate copy sales from public data
- This non-disclosure pattern applies to EA Sports FC titles

### Players vs. Copies Sold Distinction (repeatedly emphasized on Reddit)
- EA consistently reports "players" rather than "copies sold"
- "Players" includes: EA Play subscribers who trial the game (10-hour trial), free weekend participants, demo players, and actual purchasers
- Multiple Reddit comments highlighted this distinction, especially in the Dragon Age Veilguard context where "1.5 million players" was initially misreported as "1.5 million copies sold"
- This same inflated "players" metric applies to EA FC titles -- EA reports player counts that are significantly higher than actual copy sales
- Key quote from Redditor (score: 249): "Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with GeForce Now subscription"

### Historical FIFA Sales Benchmarks (from Reddit context)
- FIFA historically sells 10-15 million copies per annual title globally
- FIFA 23 was reportedly one of the best-performing entries (last game with the FIFA name)
- The rebrand to EA Sports FC coincided with declining physical sales and increased digital-only purchases
- UK retailers (e.g., Tesco) stopped carrying physical games, further reducing physical sales metrics
- FIFA franchise is among the best-selling video game franchises of all time (r/gaming, score: 3,552)
- In Europe, FIFA/FC is consistently the #1 or #2 best-selling game annually -- far more dominant than in the US

### FC 25 as Top European Seller Despite "Underperformance" (key nuance)
- Despite being widely described as underperforming on Reddit, FC 25 was the #1 best-selling game across ALL 17 tracked European countries for H1 2025 (VGChartz data, r/Games, score: 189)
- This shows that "underperformance" is relative to EA's expectations and prior FIFA titles, not an absolute failure
- The franchise's European base is so large that even a down year produces chart-topping numbers

## Summary of Findings

### Key Finding: No Specific Copy Sales Figures on Reddit
EA does not publicly disclose specific copy sales numbers for individual EA Sports FC titles. Reddit discussions reference:
- "Players" counts (inflated by EA Play trials, free weekends)
- Revenue/bookings data (which mixes copy sales with microtransaction revenue)
- Relative performance metrics (UK physical charts, European GSD data, Circana rankings)
- Qualitative assessments ("underperforming," "weakness in soccer," "bookings slid")

### Approximate Sales Estimates Based on Reddit-Discussed Data

| Game | Year | Estimated Copies Sold | Confidence | Key Evidence from Reddit |
|------|------|-----------------------|------------|--------------------------|
| EA Sports FC 24 | 2023 | ~7-12 million (lifetime) | Low | UK physical -30% vs FIFA 23 but mostly explained by digital shift; no underperformance narrative; PS Plus after 7 months (normal); historically 10-15M per title |
| EA Sports FC 25 | 2024 | ~5-8 million (lifetime) | Low | EA slashed forecasts; "bookings slid on weakness in soccer"; 50% off within 7 weeks; worst user ratings ever; revenue decline; NOT in Feb 2025 US top 20; BUT still #1 in Europe H1 2025 across all 17 countries; 905K PS copies in one discounted month |
| EA Sports FC 26 | 2025 | Too early / unknown | Very Low | #1 in Europe at launch but beaten by BF6; 62% WoW decline; 50% off within 3 months; not US #1 at launch; UK physical beaten by Ghost of Yotei; Twitch viewership down |

### Critical Caveats
1. These estimates are derived from indirect evidence on Reddit (earnings discussions, chart performance, discounting patterns, community sentiment). EA has not publicly disclosed specific copy sales figures for any EA Sports FC title on any Reddit-discussed source.
2. The "players" figures EA reports (which typically reach 20-40+ million for FIFA/FC titles) are vastly higher than actual copy sales and should NOT be used as copy sales data.
3. EA's primary revenue from the FC franchise comes from microtransactions (Ultimate Team), not copy sales. A decline in copy sales may or may not reflect a proportional decline in total franchise revenue.
4. The FC franchise's "underperformance" is relative to EA's own expectations and the franchise's historical baseline. Even a "disappointing" FC title still dominates European sales charts.

### Source Credibility Notes
- **High credibility:** Jason Schreier/Bloomberg reporting (EA forecast slash), EA earnings reports (Q3 FY25 revenue figures), Christopher Dring/GSD European chart data, Circana/NPD US chart data, VGChartz European data
- **Medium credibility:** VGC articles, PushSquare articles, GameBusiness.com analysis, individual Redditor calculations about digital vs physical shift
- **Low credibility:** Small subreddit posts (r/PlaySwapM4G FC 25 905K claim), individual Redditor estimates, Twitch viewership as sales proxy
- **Important note:** The distinction between "players" and "copies sold" was identified by multiple high-upvoted Redditor comments as a critical analytical issue when interpreting EA's public statements
