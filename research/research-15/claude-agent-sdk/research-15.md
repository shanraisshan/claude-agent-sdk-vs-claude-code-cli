**Iteration:** 15

**Year Range:** 2023-2025 (inclusive)

## Context & Methodology

EA rebranded its FIFA franchise to **EA Sports FC** starting with FC 24 (September 2023). Three titles fall within the 2023-2025 window:

| Title | Release Date | Platforms |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| EA Sports FC 24 | September 29, 2023 | PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch |
| EA Sports FC 25 | September 27, 2024 | PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch |
| EA Sports FC 26 | September/October 2025 | PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch 2 |

**Key methodological notes:**

- EA does **not** publicly disclose per-title unit sales for EA Sports FC games. All estimates below are derived from indirect evidence found in Reddit discussions of earnings reports, chart data, analyst commentary, and community analysis.
- **"Players" != copies sold.** EA reports "players" figures that include EA Play 10-hour trial users, free weekend participants, and demo players. These counts (often 20-40M+) vastly exceed actual copy sales (historically 6-15M per FIFA/FC title). Multiple high-upvoted Reddit comments highlighted this distinction (e.g., score: 249: *"Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with GeForce Now subscription"*).
- Revenue is calculated as **copies sold x blended average retail price**. The blended price accounts for: current-gen launch MSRP ($69.99), last-gen MSRP ($59.99), Switch ($39.99), regional pricing variation, and lifecycle discounts. A baseline of **$65** is typical for FC titles, adjusted per-title for exceptional discounting patterns.
- **Revenue = copy sales only.** Excludes all microtransactions, FIFA/FC Points, DLC, loot boxes, and in-app purchases. For context, 71% of EA's total revenue comes from live services (r/pcgaming, score: 2,110), meaning copy sales represent a minority of total franchise revenue.
- 16 Reddit searches were conducted across r/EASportsFC, r/Games, r/gaming, r/pcgaming, r/PS5, r/XboxSeriesX, and other subreddits, yielding **34 unique posts analyzed**.

## A. Revenue Table

| # | Title | Year | Copies Sold | Avg. Price (USD) | Revenue (USD) | Confidence |
|---|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | EA Sports FC 24 | 2023 | ~10.0M | $60 | ~$600,000,000 | Low |
| 2 | EA Sports FC 25 | 2024 | ~6.5M | $50 | ~$325,000,000 | Low |
| 3 | EA Sports FC 26 | 2025 | ~6.0M (to date) | $55 | ~$330,000,000 | Very Low |
| **TOTAL** | | | **~22.5M** | | **~$1.26B** | |

### Per-Title Pricing Rationale

- **FC 24 ($60 blended):** Standard lifecycle discounting. Current-gen $69.99, last-gen $59.99, Switch $39.99. PS Plus inclusion at 7 months (normal timing). No abnormal discounting reported. Slight markdown from $65 baseline for regional mix and standard tail discounts.
- **FC 25 ($50 blended):** Exceptionally aggressive discounting - **50% off within 7 weeks of launch** (r/PS5 comment, score: 360). This is far more aggressive than any prior FIFA/FC title. Heavy tail sales at steep discounts (905K PS copies in a single month at discount pricing). Blended down to $50 to account for majority of lifetime sales occurring at reduced prices.
- **FC 26 ($55 blended):** Early discounting continued (20-25% off within weeks; 50% off by Black Friday at 3 months post-launch). Dropped last-gen consoles (higher average console MSRP) but continued aggressive pricing. Only ~5 months of sales data; early buyers paid closer to MSRP.

### Per-Title Sales Rationale

#### EA Sports FC 24 (~10.0 million copies) - Confidence: Low

**Evidence from Reddit:**
- **UK physical sales were down 30%** vs FIFA 23 (VGC, r/XboxSeriesX, score: 456). However, a Redditor analysis showed EA is ~80% digital on consoles with ~5pp/year digital growth, meaning ~25% of the physical decline was organic format shift, leaving only ~5% real decline.
- **No underperformance narrative emerged** for FC 24 during its lifecycle. EA's FY24 earnings discussions on Reddit did not flag FC 24 as a problem.
- **FC 24 given to PS Plus in May 2024** (~7 months post-launch) - standard timing for the franchise.
- EA **removed all previous FIFA titles from Steam** when FC 24 launched (r/gaming, score: 6,164), funneling players to the new title.
- **Historical baseline:** FIFA franchise historically sells 10-15M copies per annual title. FIFA 23 was among the strongest entries.

**Estimate basis:** Historical franchise range of 10-15M, adjusted slightly downward (~5%) for rebrand impact and physical sales decline. Midpoint: **~10M**.

#### EA Sports FC 25 (~6.5 million copies) - Confidence: Low

**Evidence from Reddit:**
- **Confirmed underperformer by EA.** Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported (Jan 2025) that EA slashed fiscal year forecast: *"EA says bookings slid on weakness in soccer, Dragon Age games"* (r/pcgaming, score: 1,011; r/PS5, score: 1,503; r/EASportsFC, score: 380).
- **EA lost $6 billion in market capitalization** following the announcement (r/Games, score: 1,958). Reddit comments overwhelmingly attributed the loss to FC 25 (score: 474: *"Most of this is because of FC doing badly"*).
- **EA Q3 FY25 revenue fell** to $1.88B from $1.94B YoY (~3.1% decline), with "weakness in soccer" explicitly cited (r/Games, score: 260).
- **50% off within 7 weeks** of launch (mid-November 2024) - unprecedented for the franchise (r/PS5, score: 360).
- **Worst user-rated game in franchise history** on Metacritic, Google, and Steam (r/EASportsFC, score: 621).
- **905K copies on PlayStation alone** in June 2025 at steep discount (r/PlaySwapM4G), showing tail sales but primarily at reduced prices.
- **Despite "underperformance," still #1 in Europe** for H1 2025 across ALL 17 tracked countries (VGChartz, r/Games, score: 189) - demonstrates the franchise's enormous baseline.
- **Not in US Top 20** best sellers for February 2025 (Circana data) - dropped off quickly.

**Estimate basis:** Clear underperformance from multiple corroborating signals. Likely 25-35% below FC 24. Using midpoint of 5-8M range: **~6.5M**.

#### EA Sports FC 26 (~6.0 million copies to date) - Confidence: Very Low

**Evidence from Reddit:**
- **Debuted #1 in European charts** (GSD data) and held position for at least 3 weeks.
- **Beaten by Battlefield 6 in European launch sales** (GSD premium sales data, r/gaming, score: 890) - a significant negative signal for a franchise that historically dominated European charts.
- **Ghost of Yotei beat FC 26 in UK physical sales** (r/gaming, score: 1,239; top comment score: 814: *"Beating Fifa on sales in the UK is some feat"*).
- **Not the #1 US seller in September 2025** (Borderlands 4 topped Circana, r/Games, score: 457).
- **Sales dropped 62% week-on-week** by third week in Europe.
- **Discounted 20-25% within weeks** of launch (r/EASportsFC, score: 249); **50% off by Black Friday 2025** at less than 3 months post-launch (r/Games, score: 223).
- **Twitch viewership at launch significantly lower** than FC 24 and FC 25 launches (r/EASportsFC, score: 237), though overall Twitch viewership also declined.
- **Severe PC input delay issues at launch** (r/EASportsFC mega-thread, score: 729).
- Game was among **top sellers during Europe's Black Friday 2025**, but at 50% off.

**Estimate basis:** Only ~5 months of sales data. Launch signals (beaten by BF6 in Europe, early discounting, not US #1 at launch) suggest continued franchise weakness, but European chart dominance persists. Estimated at ~6M to date, with lifetime potentially reaching 7-9M. Using current-to-date figure: **~6M**.

## C. Key Caveats & Limitations

1. **EA does not disclose per-title unit sales.** All figures are estimates derived from indirect signals (chart positions, earnings commentary, discounting patterns, community analysis). No Reddit source cited a specific global copy sales number for any EA Sports FC title. EA has a documented pattern of refusing to disclose unit sales for underperforming titles (see: Battlefield 2042, r/pcgaming, score: 4,544).

2. **Revenue is copy sales only.** The FIFA/FC franchise generates the majority of its revenue from FIFA/FC Points (microtransactions in Ultimate Team). Copy sale revenue represents a fraction of total franchise revenue. The $1.26B total represents only copy sale revenue.

3. **FC 26 lifecycle is ongoing.** The game was only ~5 months old at the time of research. The estimate of ~6M copies reflects sales to date, not projected lifetime sales.

4. **Blended pricing varies by title.** The typical $65 baseline was adjusted downward for all three titles to account for: FC 24's standard but meaningful lifecycle discounts ($60); FC 25's unprecedented 50%-off-in-7-weeks discounting ($50); and FC 26's continued aggressive early discounting ($55). Actual average selling prices could differ.

5. **"Players" counts are not used.** EA's reported player figures (which reach 20-40M+ for FIFA/FC titles) include EA Play trial users, free weekend participants, and demo players. These are explicitly excluded from copy sales estimates per this analysis.

6. **Overall confidence is LOW.** The total revenue figure of ~$1.26B should be treated as a rough order-of-magnitude estimate. The true figure could reasonably range from ~$0.9B to ~$1.6B depending on actual copy volumes and effective pricing that EA has not disclosed.
