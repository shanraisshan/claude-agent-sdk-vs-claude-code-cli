## DETAILED REDDIT POST ANALYSIS

### POST 1: EA Sports FC 24 attracted more players at launch than FIFA 23
- **ID:** 173ttp3
- **Subreddit:** r/pcgaming
- **Author:** M337ING
- **Score:** 0 (downvoted, 0.44 upvote ratio) | **Comments:** 19
- **Date:** 2023-10-09
- **URL:** https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-sports-fc-24-attracted-more-players-at-launch-than-fifa-23-ea-has-suggested/
- **Permalink:** https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/173ttp3/

**Key Comment (u/Firefox72, score 28):**
> "EA Sports FC 24 attracted 'more than 11.3 million players worldwide, including through EA Play', during its first week, the company has claimed. In comparison, a similar press release announcing last year's 'record-breaking launch of FIFA 23' said the game reached 10.3 million players in its first week."

**Key Comment (u/TemporalAntiAssening, score 5):**
> "More people downloaded the trial through game pass. Whether that translates into sales is yet to be seen."

**SALES DATA EXTRACTED:**
- **EA Sports FC 24: 11.3 million players worldwide in first week** (includes EA Play trial users)
- **FIFA 23 comparison: 10.3 million players in first week**
- CRITICAL CAVEAT: "players" includes EA Play and Game Pass subscribers who trialed the game; actual copies sold would be meaningfully lower

### POST 2: UK physical sales for EA FC are down 30% compared to FIFA 23
- **ID:** 16xtqme
- **Subreddit:** r/XboxSeriesX
- **Author:** F0REM4N
- **Score:** 463 | **Comments:** 166 | **Upvote Ratio:** 0.91
- **Date:** 2023-10-02
- **URL:** https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/uk-physical-sales-for-ea-fc-are-down-30-compared-to-fifa-23/

**Key Comment (u/irJess, score 222):**
> "I work at Tesco, we have actually stopped physical game sales in the last year. I'm sure the name change does contribute but I do believe a large amount would have bought digital this year."

**Key Comment (u/mocoworm, score 201):**
> "But what are the overall sales? I would expect physical to be down YoY as that media is declining."

**Key Comment (u/NotFromMilkyWay, score 4):**
> "Just for numbers sake: EA is 80% digital across console platforms according to their financial reports. Digital growth is around 5 percentage points per year. So if last year they sold 20% of FIFA physically that means they sold 15% this year. Just from that effect alone it would be expected for physical sales to be 25% less than last year. It's at 30% instead. So it sells pretty well. I doubt 5% of physical copies equal the 400 million per year FIFA demanded."

**SALES DATA EXTRACTED:**
- **EA Sports FC 24 UK physical sales: down 30% vs FIFA 23**
- EA is ~80% digital across console platforms (per EA financial reports)
- The 30% decline is mostly explained by digital shift (~25% expected); only ~5% is actual sales decline
- FIFA license cost EA ~$400 million per year

**Key Comment (u/Cynical_onlooker, score 1146):**
> "Honestly, the thing that surprises me most about this news was how realistic EA's expectations were for the sales."

**Key Comment (u/Forestl, score 475):**
> "Most of this is because of FC doing badly. They've made a shit ton of money from that game and it has helped them through other flops. To see those numbers going down is very bad"

**Key Comment (u/FlukyS, score 189):**
> "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual... I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm excited to see what 2K do with the FIFA license."

**Key Comment (u/vKEVUv, score 244):**
> "EA always had big internal expectations so a fact they only forecasted 3 million 'players' during initial sales window for AAA Dragon Age RPG... Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription..."

**Key Comment (u/BurzyGuerrero, score 17):**
> "EA FC25 underperforming is way more of an issue for EA than dragon age. People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore."

**SALES DATA EXTRACTED:**
- EA slashed fiscal year forecast due to FC 25 and Dragon Age underperformance
- FC 25 underperformance characterized as a bigger concern than Dragon Age
- Commentary highlights that EA deliberately uses "players" rather than "copies sold"

**Key Comment (u/Santino_18, score 358):**

**Key Comment (u/whyamihere2473527, score 450):**
> "50% is bad but imo if expectations were only 3 million i feel like that is a low bar for a popular established franchise..."

**SALES DATA EXTRACTED:**
- **FC 25 was half-price within ~7 weeks of launch** (by mid-November 2024)
- Rapid discounting signals poor initial sales velocity

**Key Comment (u/Villag3Idiot, score 18):**
> "Are people finally tired of EA's annual sports game rehash or is there some other reason?"

**SALES DATA EXTRACTED:**

**Key Comment (u/PhriendlyPhantom, score 123):**
> "They won't care because they still made a shit tonne of money"

**SALES DATA EXTRACTED:**

- **URL:** https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/battlefield-6-launch-sales-bigger

**Key Comment (u/SamShakusky71, score 248):**
> "There are a few caveats. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was included in Xbox Game Pass, which means it's likely Call of Duty had a far higher player count than Battlefield 6. This GSD data is purely premium sales."

**SALES DATA EXTRACTED:**
- **Battlefield 6 outsold EA Sports FC 26 in European launch premium sales** (GSD data)
- This is unusual -- EA's own shooter franchise outperformed their soccer franchise in Europe

- Per commenter u/NotFromMilkyWay: EA is ~80% digital on consoles; ~25% of the 30% decline is from digital shift, only ~5% is actual organic decline
- FIFA license was costing EA ~$400M/year; even with a sales decline, EA saves money on the rebrand

**Pricing/Distribution Context:**
- FC 24 was 50% off by November 13, 2023 (~6 weeks after launch) (post 17umubg)
- FC 24 was included in PlayStation Plus monthly games in May 2024 (~7 months after launch) (posts 1chp0eh, 1chp0kt)

**Specific Copy Sales Figures:**
- **NO CONFIRMED TOTAL COPY SALES FIGURE FOUND ON REDDIT**
- EA does not publicly disclose unit sales; they report "players" and "net bookings"
- Based on Reddit analysis: if 11.3M played in first week and ~60-75% were actual purchasers (per Reddit consensus about EA Play inflation), estimated first-week copies sold is approximately **6.8-8.5 million**
- No lifetime/cumulative sales figure found

### EA Sports FC 25 (Released September 27, 2024)

**Official EA-Reported Data (Found on Reddit):**
- **No specific player count or copy sales figure for FC 25 was found on Reddit**
- EA did NOT issue a first-week player count press release for FC 25 (unlike FC 24's 11.3M announcement) -- this silence is itself significant
- FC 25 **broke the US launch month REVENUE record for soccer games** per Circana/NPD (post 1gb1zth) -- but this is DOLLAR REVENUE (driven by expensive editions), not unit sales

**Underperformance Evidence (Found on Reddit):**
- EA slashed full fiscal year forecast (January 22, 2025) due to FC 25 and Dragon Age underperformance (posts 1i7m0ck, 1i7m1am, 1i8x6am)
  - Full-year guidance lowered to $7.0-7.15B from $7.5-7.8B (a ~$500-650M cut)
  - Source: Jason Schreier / Bloomberg
- **EA lost $6 billion in market value** following the news (post 1i8x6am)
- EA Q3 FY2025 revenue fell to **$1.88B from $1.94B** year-over-year (post 1ihva33)
- **FC 25 was half-price by mid-November 2024** (~7 weeks after launch) (comment by u/Santino_18, post 1i7m1am)

**User Reception Data:**
- **Worst user-rated game in franchise history** across Metacritic, Google Audience Rating, and Steam (post 1n7ixhg)
- Multiple posts about frustration, with u/BurzyGuerrero noting "People aren't buying the cards as much anymore"

**Specific Copy Sales Figures:**
- **NO CONFIRMED TOTAL COPY SALES FIGURE FOUND ON REDDIT**
- The absence of a public player count announcement (unlike FC 24's 11.3M) strongly suggests EA was not pleased with the numbers
- Early deep discounting and rapid addition to Game Pass (June 2025) suggest shortened premium sales window

### EA Sports FC 26 (Released September 18, 2025)

**Sales Indicators (Found on Reddit):**

- **Battlefield 6 outsold FC 26 in European launch premium sales** (post 1o9atzm) -- GSD data
- FC 26 was among **top sellers during Black Friday 2025 in Europe** (post 1pfo1ph) -- still performs in discount windows
- Significant PC launch issues (input delay, post 1npg5mw)

**Specific Copy Sales Figures:**
- **NO CONFIRMED TOTAL COPY SALES FIGURE FOUND ON REDDIT**
- FC 26 is still relatively new (released ~5 months ago as of this research date)

## KEY OBSERVATIONS AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

### 1. EA Deliberately Obscures Copy Sales
EA uses "players" language (not "copies sold") in all public communications. Reddit discussions consistently highlight this distinction. The 11.3 million "players" figure for FC 24 is the closest available metric, but it includes EA Play trial users, Game Pass subscribers, and free weekend players.

### 2. No VGChartz or Confirmed Unit Figures Exist on Reddit
Despite extensive searching across 20+ queries and 10+ subreddits, no Reddit post contains a confirmed total copies sold figure for any EA Sports FC title. VGChartz-style unit tracking discussions are absent for this franchise.

### 3. FC 25's Underperformance is Well-Documented but Not Quantified in Units
The financial impact of FC 25's underperformance is extensively documented (forecast slashes, $6B market cap loss, revenue decline). However, the specific unit sales shortfall is never quantified in Reddit posts. The most telling indicator is that EA did NOT issue a public player count milestone for FC 25 (unlike FC 24's 11.3M announcement).

### 4. Revenue vs. Unit Sales Paradox for FC 25
FC 25 simultaneously broke the US launch revenue record for soccer games AND underperformed badly enough to cause a ~$500-650M forecast cut. This is likely explained by: (a) higher premium edition pricing boosting launch revenue per unit, and (b) a massive drop in sustained engagement/microtransaction spending after launch.

### 5. Physical Sales Data Skews the Picture
UK physical sales data (FC 24 down 30% vs FIFA 23; FC 26 beaten by Ghost of Yotei) is frequently discussed on Reddit but represents only ~10-20% of total sales. Multiple commenters note that physical-only data is increasingly unreliable.

### 6. The r/FIFA Subreddit is Unavailable
The r/FIFA subreddit is private/quarantined, which limited the ability to search for historical franchise sales discussions. The r/EASportsFC subreddit is active but primarily focused on gameplay/tactics rather than sales data.
