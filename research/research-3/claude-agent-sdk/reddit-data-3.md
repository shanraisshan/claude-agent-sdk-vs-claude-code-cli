## DETAILED REDDIT POST ANALYSIS

### POST 1: EA Sports FC 24 attracted more players at launch than FIFA 23
- **ID:** 173ttp3 | **Subreddit:** r/pcgaming | **Score:** 0 (0.44 ratio) | **Comments:** 19
- **Date:** 2023-10-09
- **URL:** https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-sports-fc-24-attracted-more-players-at-launch-than-fifa-23-ea-has-suggested/
- **Key Comment (u/Firefox72, score 28):** "EA Sports FC 24 attracted 'more than 11.3 million players worldwide, including through EA Play', during its first week... FIFA 23 reached 10.3 million players in its first week."
- **Key Comment (u/TemporalAntiAssening, score 5):** "More people downloaded the trial through game pass. Whether that translates into sales is yet to be seen."
- **DATA:** FC 24: 11.3M players week 1. FIFA 23: 10.3M players week 1. Both include EA Play trial users.

### POST 2: UK physical sales for EA FC 24 down 30% vs FIFA 23
- **ID:** 16xtqme | **Subreddit:** r/XboxSeriesX | **Score:** 463 | **Comments:** 166
- **Date:** 2023-10-02

- **Key Comment (u/NotFromMilkyWay, score 4):** "EA is 80% digital across console platforms... Digital growth is around 5 percentage points per year.

So it sells pretty well."

## PER-GAME COPY SALES SUMMARY

### FIFA 23 (Released September 30, 2022)

**Official EA Data Found on Reddit:**
- **10.3 million players in first week** (EA press release, per VGC article discussed in post 173ttp3)
- "Players" includes EA Play subscribers and trial users

**Sales Context from Reddit:**
- FIFA 23 was **#1 best-selling game on Steam** at launch (post xnw813)
- FIFA is consistently **Europe's fastest-selling game** -- used as the benchmark against which all other launches are measured (posts 11ky1mc, t5txhx)
- FIFA 23 was in the **top 5 best-selling US games for 2023** mid-year (Circana, post 14li1no)
- FIFA license cost EA **$150M/year** (post q7tnmc)

**Estimated Copy Sales:**
- No explicit total copies-sold figure found on Reddit
- Applying 60-75% purchaser ratio to 10.3M first-week "players": **~6.2-7.7 million copies** in first week
- Industry context: FIFA annual titles typically sell **10-15+ million copies** lifetime
- FIFA 23 may have had a "last FIFA ever" boost

---

### EA Sports FC 24 (Released September 29, 2023)

**Official EA Data Found on Reddit:**
- **11.3 million players worldwide in first week** (EA press release, posts 173ttp3 and 17pbktt)
- **14.5 million players in first month** (EA announcement, post 17pbktt)
- Comparison: FIFA 23 reached 10.3 million players in first week
- CRITICAL CAVEAT: "Players" includes EA Play subscribers, Game Pass trial users, free trial participants

**Physical Sales Data:**
- **UK physical sales down 30% vs FIFA 23** (GfK data, Christopher Dring, post 16xtqme)
- Per commenter: EA is ~80% digital on consoles; ~25% of the 30% decline is from digital shift, only ~5% is actual organic decline
- FIFA license was costing EA ~$400M/year

**Pricing/Distribution:**
- **50% off by November 13, 2023** (~6 weeks after launch) (post 17umubg)
- **Included in PS Plus monthly games May 2024** (~7 months post-launch) (post 1chp0eh)

**Estimated Copy Sales:**
- **NO CONFIRMED TOTAL COPY SALES FIGURE FOUND ON REDDIT**
- First-week estimate: 11.3M players x 60-75% purchaser ratio = **~6.8-8.5 million copies** first week
- First-month estimate: 14.5M players x 60-75% = **~8.7-10.9 million copies** first month
- UK retail sales decline of 30% suggests modest overall decline from FIFA 23 in actual unit sales

---

### EA Sports FC 25 (Released September 27, 2024)

**Official EA Data Found on Reddit:**
- **NO specific player count or copy sales figure disclosed** -- EA did NOT issue a first-week player count press release (unlike FC 24's 11.3M announcement). This silence is significant.
- FC 25 **broke the US launch month REVENUE record** for soccer games per Circana/NPD (post 1gb1zth) -- but this is DOLLAR revenue driven by premium editions ($100+), not unit sales

**Underperformance Evidence:**
- EA **slashed full fiscal year forecast** (January 22, 2025) -- guidance lowered to **$7.0-7.15B from $7.5-7.8B** (~$500-650M cut) (posts 1i7m0ck, 1i7m1am, 1i7tlu8)
- EA **lost $6 billion in market capitalization** (post 1i8x6am)
- EA Q3 FY2025 revenue: **$1.88B** (down from $1.94B YoY) (post 1ihva33)
- FC 25 was **half-price by mid-November 2024** (~7 weeks after launch) (post 1i7m1am comment)
- FC 25 added to **Xbox Game Pass June 2025** (~9 months post-launch) (post 1l3yklu)
- **Worst user-rated game in franchise history** across Metacritic, Google, Steam (post 1n7ixhg)
- Bloomberg confirmed **"decline in both spending and sales"** for FC franchise (post 1i7osuj)

**Despite Underperformance:**
- FC 25 was still **#1 in all 17 tracked European countries** for H1 2025 (post 1m2vrvv)

**Revenue vs. Unit Sales Paradox:**
- FC 25 simultaneously broke the US launch revenue record AND underperformed badly enough for a ~$500-650M guidance cut
- Explanation: higher premium edition pricing ($100+ Ultimate editions) boosted launch revenue per unit, but sustained engagement and microtransaction spending dropped significantly

**Estimated Copy Sales:**
- **NO CONFIRMED FIGURE FOUND ON REDDIT**
- The absence of a public player count announcement strongly suggests numbers were disappointing
- Reddit consensus: FC 25 sold significantly fewer copies than FC 24

### EA Sports FC 26 (Released September 18, 2025)

**Sales Indicators Found on Reddit:**
- **Ghost of Yotei beat FC 26 in UK physical launch sales** (post 1nzc677) -- historically very unusual
- **Battlefield 6 outsold FC 26 in European launch premium sales** (post 1o9atzm, GSD data)
- FC 26 does **NOT appear in US top 10 best-selling games of 2025** (post 1qpfsp3) -- significant absence
- FC 26 was among **top sellers during Black Friday 2025 in Europe** (post 1pfo1ph) -- performs in discount windows
- Significant **PC input delay issues** at launch (post 1npg5mw)
- Negative user reception continues (post 1p9xn9n)

**Estimated Copy Sales:**
- **NO CONFIRMED FIGURE FOUND ON REDDIT**
- Being beaten in UK physical and European launch comparisons, plus absence from US top 10, suggests continued franchise decline
- FC 26 is still relatively recent (~5 months old at time of research)

### 2K FIFA Game / Other FIFA-Branded Titles

- Rumored since February 2024 (post 1ap1vgf)
- NOT released as of February 2026
- **0 copies sold**

## KEY OBSERVATIONS

### 1. EA Deliberately Obscures Copy Sales
EA uses "players" language (not "copies sold") in all public communications. Reddit discussions consistently highlight this distinction (posts 173ttp3, 1i7m0ck, 1i7n2pf). The 11.3M/14.5M "players" figures for FC 24 include EA Play trial users, Game Pass subscribers, and free weekend players.

### 2. No VGChartz or Confirmed Unit Figures Exist on Reddit
Despite 44 search queries across 10+ subreddits, no Reddit post contains a confirmed total copies-sold figure for any EA Sports FC title.

### 3. FC 25's Underperformance is Documented but Not Quantified in Units
The financial impact is extensive ($6B market cap loss, $500-650M guidance cut, Q3 revenue decline). But specific unit sales shortfall is never quantified. The most telling indicator: EA did NOT issue a public player count milestone for FC 25.

### 4. Revenue vs. Units Paradox
FC 25 broke the US launch revenue record while being an underperformer -- explained by higher-priced premium editions ($100+) and subsequent collapse in engagement/MTX spending.

### 5. Physical Sales Data is Misleading
UK physical sales data (FC 24 -30% vs FIFA 23; FC 26 beaten by Ghost of Yotei) is frequently discussed but represents only ~10-20% of total sales.

### 6. r/FIFA is Unavailable
The original r/FIFA subreddit is private/quarantined, limiting access to historical franchise sales discussions.
