# Research Report: FIFA / EA Sports FC Game Sales (2023–2025)
## Iteration 3 | Agent: Claude Agent SDK | Date: 2026-02-19

## Context & Methodology

In 2023, EA's licensing agreement with FIFA expired, and the franchise rebranded from **FIFA** to **EA Sports FC**. All premium soccer/football games released by EA from 2023–2025 carry the EA Sports FC branding. A rumored 2K-published FIFA-branded game has **not** been released as of February 2026. Free-to-play titles (EA Sports FC Mobile, EA Sports FC Online) are excluded — they generate no copy sales revenue.

Data was gathered from 21 Reddit search queries across 10+ subreddits (r/Games, r/gaming, r/EASportsFC, r/pcgaming, r/PS5, r/XboxSeriesX, r/gamernews, etc.), analyzing 47 Reddit posts. No confirmed unit sales figures exist on Reddit for any EA Sports FC title. All estimates are derived from:

1. EA's official "player" counts (adjusted downward for trial/subscription inflation)
2. UK physical sales tracking data (GfK/Circana) discussed on Reddit
3. EA quarterly earnings data and forecast revisions referenced on Reddit
4. Launch pricing behavior (speed-to-discount as a sales velocity proxy)
5. Comparative sales indicators (e.g., losing to Ghost of Yotei, Battlefield 6)

**Key analytical caveats applied:**
- EA reports "players," not copies sold. Player counts include EA Play, Xbox Game Pass, PS Plus trial users, and other non-purchasers. Reddit consensus and analyst guidance: actual purchasers are **60–75%** of reported player counts.
- When a title is described as "underperforming" with EA slashing forecasts and losing billions in market value, the **lower end** of estimate ranges is used.
- For games in their active sales window (<6 months since launch), **conservative estimates** are used — lifetime sales are not yet reached.
- Retail pricing is a weighted average across all launch platforms: current-gen ($69.99), last-gen ($59.99), PC ($59.99), Switch Legacy ($39.99). Current-gen-only titles use ~$67.

## Estimate Rationale

### EA Sports FC 24 (September 29, 2023)
- **Platforms:** PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch
- **EA reported data:** 11.3M "players" in first week (EA press release, per VGC — Reddit post 173ttp3). Comparison: FIFA 23 reached 10.3M players in its first week.
- **Critical caveat:** "Players" includes EA Play trial users, Game Pass subscribers, and free trial participants — NOT pure copy sales (highlighted by multiple Reddit commenters, e.g., u/TemporalAntiAssening: "More people downloaded the trial through game pass").
- **UK retail sales:** 30% below FIFA 23 per GfK data (Reddit post 16xtqme). Per Reddit commenter u/NotFromMilkyWay (citing EA financial reports): EA is ~80% digital on consoles, digital shift alone accounts for ~25% of the physical decline, leaving only ~5% organic sales decline.
- **Copy sales estimate:** 11.3M first-week players × 65% purchaser ratio (midpoint of 60–75%) = ~7.3M first-week purchasers. FIFA/FC titles typically achieve 1.5× first-week-to-lifetime ratio. Estimated lifetime: **~11M copies**. This is consistent with only a ~5% organic decline from FIFA 23's estimated ~12M.
- **Pricing context:** FC 24 was 50% off by November 13, 2023 (~6 weeks post-launch, Reddit post 17umubg). Added to PlayStation Plus in May 2024 (~7 months post-launch, Reddit post 1chp0eh), indicating premium sales window largely closed.
- **Pricing:** Multi-platform including last-gen and Switch Legacy Edition ($39.99). Weighted average across PS5 ($69.99), PS4 ($59.99), Xbox ($69.99/$59.99), PC ($59.99), Switch ($39.99): ~$63.
- **Confidence: Medium** — EA disclosed first-week player count; GfK provided directional retail data; the 60–75% purchaser adjustment is well-supported by Reddit analyst discussions.

### EA Sports FC 25 (September 27, 2024)
- **Platforms:** PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch
- **EA reported data:** No player count or sales figures were publicly announced. This silence is itself a significant negative signal — FC 24 received a public 11.3M first-week announcement.
- **Revenue record paradox:** FC 25 broke the US launch month **revenue** record for soccer games per Circana/NPD (Reddit post 1gb1zth). This is **dollar revenue, not unit sales** — likely driven by higher-priced Ultimate/Deluxe editions ($100+ SKUs), not by volume.
- **Underperformance confirmed by:**
  - Jason Schreier/Bloomberg (Jan 22, 2025): EA slashed FY guidance by $500–650M (from $7.5–7.8B to $7.0–7.15B), attributable to FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard (Reddit posts 1i7m0ck/r/pcgaming, 1i7m1am/r/PS5)
  - EA lost **$6 billion in market value** following the announcement (Reddit post 1i8x6am/r/Games, score 1954)
  - EA Q3 FY2025 revenue fell to $1.88B from $1.94B YoY (Reddit post 1ihva33/r/Games)
  - Multiple Reddit commenters identified FC as the bigger concern vs. Dragon Age (u/Forestl: "Most of this is because of FC doing badly"; u/BurzyGuerrero: "EA FC25 underperforming is way more of an issue for EA than dragon age")
- **Pricing behavior:** FC 25 was discounted **50% within ~7 weeks of launch** (by mid-November 2024, per u/Santino_18 in post 1i7m1am). Added to Game Pass by June 2025 (~9 months post-launch).
- **User reception:** Worst user-rated game in franchise history across Metacritic, Google Audience Rating, and Steam (Reddit post 1n7ixhg/r/EASportsFC, score 624).
- **Copy sales estimate:** Per rules, use LOWER end for underperforming titles with slashed forecasts and market value losses. **~7M copies lifetime.** This represents a ~36% decline from FC 24, consistent with the magnitude of EA's guidance revision and the absence of any public player milestone.
- **Pricing:** Same platform mix as FC 24. Weighted average: ~$63.
- **Confidence: Low** — No official player counts or sales figures; estimate derived entirely from underperformance signals, guidance cuts, and relative franchise decline trajectory.

### EA Sports FC 26 (September 18, 2025)
- **Platforms:** PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC (dropped last-gen PS4/Xbox One and Nintendo Switch — significantly smaller addressable install base)
- **EA reported data:** No player counts or sales figures disclosed.
- **Launch performance signals:**
  - **Lost to Ghost of Yotei in UK physical launch sales** (Reddit post 1nzc677/r/gaming, score 1243) — historically unprecedented for FIFA/FC in the UK. Reddit commenter u/pogray (score 813): "Beating Fifa on sales in the UK is some feat."
  - **Beaten by Battlefield 6 in European premium launch sales** per GSD data (Reddit post 1o9atzm/r/gaming, score 891) — EA's own shooter franchise outperformed their soccer franchise in Europe.
  - Among **top sellers during Black Friday 2025 in Europe** (Reddit post 1pfo1ph/r/Games) — still performs during discount windows.
  - Significant **PC input delay issues at launch** (Reddit post 1npg5mw/r/EASportsFC, mega-thread).
- **Copy sales estimate:** Per rules, use conservative estimates for games in active sales window (<6 months since launch). FC 26 is only ~5 months old. Dropping last-gen platforms removes a significant portion of the addressable market. **~5M copies sold to date.** Lifetime sales will likely reach 7–9M.
- **Pricing:** Current-gen + PC only (no $40 Switch or $60 last-gen editions). PS5/XSX $69.99, PC $69.99. Weighted average: ~$67.
- **Confidence: Low** — No official data; game is still in active sales window; estimate based on declining franchise trajectory and weak comparative launch performance.

### Excluded Titles
- **2K FIFA Game:** Rumored since Feb 2024; **not released** as of Feb 2026. 0 copies sold.
- **EA Sports FC Mobile / FC Online:** Free-to-play. No copy sales. Excluded per rules.

## Limitations & Caveats

1. **EA does not disclose unit copy sales.** All estimates are derived from EA's "player" counts (which inflate actual purchasers by 25–40%) and directional performance indicators (UK GfK data, underperformance disclosures, guidance revisions).
2. **FC 25 and FC 26 have no official player counts or sales data.** Estimates for these titles rely entirely on qualitative signals (underperformance reports, market cap loss, comparative launch performance).
3. **FC 26 is still in its active sales window** (~5 months old). The 5M estimate is a point-in-time figure; lifetime sales will likely reach 7–9M.
4. **Revenue excludes all microtransactions, FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) spending, DLC, and in-app purchases.** FUT revenue alone typically exceeds copy sales revenue for the FIFA/FC franchise — EA's actual total franchise revenue is multiples of the figures reported here.
5. **No 2K FIFA game has been released** despite 2024 rumors. The FIFA gaming market from 2023–2025 consists solely of EA's three EA Sports FC titles.
6. **The r/FIFA subreddit is private/quarantined**, which limited the ability to search for historical franchise sales discussions.
