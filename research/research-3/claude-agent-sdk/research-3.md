# Research Report: FIFA / EA Sports FC Games (2023–2025) — Copy Sales Revenue
## Iteration 3 | Agent: Claude Agent SDK | Date: 2026-02-19

---

## Methodology

**Scope:** All premium paid FIFA / EA Sports FC games **released** between 2023 and 2025. Free-to-play mobile titles (FIFA Mobile, EA Sports FC Mobile) are excluded — they have no copy sales.

**Revenue formula:** `Copies Sold × Average Retail Price at Launch`
- Only physical + digital copy sales counted
- Microtransactions, DLC, loot boxes, Ultimate Team packs, and in-app purchases are **excluded**
- "Players" reported by EA ≠ copies sold. EA counts EA Play, Game Pass, and PS Plus trial users as "players." A 60–75% purchaser-to-player conversion ratio is applied per industry analysis (Reddit consensus across r/pcgaming, r/Games, r/stocks)

**Pricing methodology:** Weighted average across all launch platforms using estimated platform split. Only launch MSRP is used (not discounted prices).

**Research scope:** 44 search queries | 400+ posts scanned | 33 posts analyzed in detail | 10+ subreddits covered

## Detailed Estimates & Reasoning

### 1. EA Sports FC 24 — 11.0M copies, $704M revenue (Medium confidence)

**Data points:**
- EA reported **11.3M players first week** and **14.5M players first month** (Reddit posts 173ttp3/r/pcgaming, 17pbktt/r/M8X_GAMENEWS)
- "Players" includes EA Play trial users, Game Pass subscribers (u/TemporalAntiAssening, post 173ttp3: "More people downloaded the trial through game pass")
- UK physical sales **down 30%** vs FIFA 23 (GfK data, post 16xtqme/r/XboxSeriesX) — but ~25% of that decline attributed to digital shift; only ~5% organic decline (u/NotFromMilkyWay: "EA is 80% digital across console platforms")
- Game was **50% off within 6 weeks** (post 17umubg/r/EASportsFC)
- Added to **PS Plus May 2024** (~7 months post-launch) (post 1chp0eh/r/PS5)

**Copy sales calculation:**
- 14.5M first-month players × 65% purchaser ratio (mid-range of 60-75%) = **~9.4M copies** in first month
- Tail sales through holiday 2023 and early 2024 (including heavy discounting) add ~15-20%
- PS Plus inclusion in May 2024 caps further paid sales
- **Lifetime estimate: ~11.0M copies**

**Pricing:**
- PS5/XSX: $69.99 (~50%) | PS4/XB1: $59.99 (~25%) | PC: $59.99 (~20%) | Switch Legacy: $39.99 (~5%)
- **Weighted average: ~$64**

---

### 2. EA Sports FC 25 — 8.0M copies, $512M revenue (Low confidence)

**Data points:**
- EA did **NOT disclose any player count** — a significant break from FC 24's announcements. This silence is the strongest indicator of disappointing numbers.
- FC 25 **broke the US launch month REVENUE record** for soccer games (Circana/NPD, post 1gb1zth/r/gamernews) — but this is dollar revenue driven by $100+ premium editions, not unit volume.
- EA **slashed fiscal year guidance by $500–650M** (posts 1i7tlu8/r/stocks, 1i7m0ck/r/pcgaming, 1i7m1am/r/PS5) — from $7.5-7.8B to $7.0-7.15B.
- EA **lost $6 billion in market capitalization** (post 1i8x6am/r/Games, score 1956)
- EA Q3 FY2025 revenue: **$1.88B** (down from $1.94B YoY) (post 1ihva33/r/Games)
- Game was **half-price within ~7 weeks** (u/Santino_18, post 1i7m1am: "FC25 released September 27th and was half price mid-November")
- **Worst user-rated game** in franchise history across Metacritic, Google, Steam (post 1n7ixhg/r/EASportsFC)
- Bloomberg confirmed **"decline in both spending and sales"** (post 1i7osuj/r/EASportsFC)
- Despite underperformance, was still **#1 in all 17 tracked European countries** for H1 2025 (post 1m2vrvv/r/Games)
- Added to **Game Pass June 2025** (~9 months post-launch) (post 1l3yklu/r/Games)

**Copy sales calculation:**
- Per rules: *"When a title is described as 'underperforming' with EA slashing forecasts, losing billions in market value, or being discounted 50% within 2 months, use the LOWER end of estimate ranges."* — FC 25 matches **all three criteria**.
- Launch was reasonably strong (revenue record), so first-month copies likely ~8-9M players × 60% (lower bound) = ~4.8-5.4M first month
- Tail sales through holiday 2024 and H1 2025 (heavy discounting + still #1 Europe) add significant volume
- But engagement collapsed, limiting word-of-mouth driven late sales
- **Lifetime estimate: ~8.0M copies** (lower end of range per rules)

**Revenue vs. Units Paradox:**
FC 25 simultaneously broke the US launch revenue record AND underperformed badly enough for a ~$500-650M guidance cut. Explanation: higher-priced premium editions ($100+ Ultimate editions) boosted launch revenue per unit, but sustained engagement and microtransaction spending dropped significantly. The guidance cut encompasses BOTH reduced copy sales AND reduced FUT/MTX revenue.

**Pricing:**
- Same platform/price structure as FC 24
- **Weighted average: ~$64**

### 3. EA Sports FC 26 — 4.5M copies, $315M revenue (Low confidence)

**Data points:**
- **Lost UK physical launch to Ghost of Yotei** (post 1nzc677/r/gaming, score 1236) — u/pogray (score 816): "Beating Fifa on sales in the UK is some feat"
- **Beaten by Battlefield 6** in European launch premium sales (GSD data, post 1o9atzm/r/gaming)
- **NOT in US top 10 best-selling games of 2025** (post 1qpfsp3/r/gaming) — notable absence for a FIFA franchise title
- Performed well during **Black Friday 2025 in Europe** (post 1pfo1ph/r/Games) — discount-window performance
- Significant **PC input delay issues** at launch (post 1npg5mw/r/EASportsFC)
- **Dropped last-gen consoles and Switch** — smaller addressable install base (~25-30% reduction)
- EA sold for **$55 billion** during FC 26's sales window (post 1ntgp6o/r/EASportsFC) — corporate transition may have deprioritized marketing
- Only ~5 months of sales data at time of research

**Copy sales calculation:**
- Per rules: *"For games still in their active sales window (< 6 months since launch), use conservative estimates."*
- Physical loss to Ghost of Yotei and BF6 suggest weakened launch, but physical is only ~10-15% of total
- Absence from US top 10 is significant — suggests sub-5M US sales in 2025's ~3-month window
- Smaller platform base (no last-gen, no Switch) reduces addressable market
- **Current estimate: ~4.5M copies** (conservative; active sales window; lifetime may reach 7-9M)

**Pricing:**
- PS5: $69.99 | XSX: $69.99 | PC: $69.99 — current-gen exclusive, no last-gen/Switch to bring average down
- Per rules: *"Only use $70 if the game is current-gen exclusive"* — FC 26 qualifies
- **Weighted average: ~$70**

## Limitations & Caveats

1. **No confirmed copy sales figures exist on Reddit.** EA deliberately uses "players" instead of "copies sold" in all public communications. All copy figures are estimates derived from player counts (with 60-75% purchaser conversion) and contextual indicators.

2. **The $500–650M guidance cut for FC 25 includes microtransaction revenue decline**, not just copy sales shortfall. The actual shortfall in copy revenue may be $130–200M, with the remainder from reduced Ultimate Team spending.

3. **FC 26 is still in its active sales window** (~5 months post-launch). The 4.5M estimate represents sales-to-date; lifetime may reach 7-9M.

4. **Revenue excludes ALL post-purchase monetization.** EA Sports FC's Ultimate Team mode alone generates billions annually. Actual total franchise revenue is multiples of the copy sale revenue reported here.

5. **Physical sales data is disproportionately represented** on Reddit (UK GfK, GSD), but represents only ~10-15% of total game sales. Digital sales are not publicly disclosed.

6. **r/FIFA is private/quarantined**, limiting access to historical franchise sales discussions.

7. **No 2K FIFA game has been released** despite 2024 rumors. The FIFA gaming market 2023-2025 consists solely of EA's three EA Sports FC titles.
