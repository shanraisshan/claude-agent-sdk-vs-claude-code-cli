      SDK output was generated manually (endpoint not available), so similarity was artificially high.
      Real SDK integration via Agent SDK had not been tested yet — no CLAUDECODE env var issue discovered.

      First real Agent SDK run — fixed CLAUDECODE nested session blocker and mcp_servers config.
      SDK overestimated copies sold for FC 24/25/26 due to conflating "players" with purchasers; added conservative estimation rules.

      SDK now finds correct 3 games (100% coverage). FC 24 and FC 25 revenue within 10% tolerance.
      FC 26 underestimated at $335M vs CLI $455M (26% gap) due to overly conservative active-sales-window rule and $67 pricing.
      Evolved rules: estimate from franchise trajectory, use $70 for current-gen-only titles.

      Regression from 83.33% to 37.5%. Problem statement changed from 1990-2026 to 2023-2025, revealing new issues.
      SDK missed FIFA 23 (actively sold in 2023 but released 2022). SDK used $62 blended price instead of $70.
      SDK used 65% player-to-purchaser ratio (too low). Evolved: include actively-sold games, use $70 default, 75-80% ratio.
