      SDK output was generated manually (endpoint not available), so similarity was artificially high.
      Real SDK integration via Agent SDK had not been tested yet — no CLAUDECODE env var issue discovered.

      First real Agent SDK run — fixed CLAUDECODE nested session blocker and mcp_servers config.
      SDK overestimated copies sold for FC 24/25/26 due to conflating "players" with purchasers; added conservative estimation rules.

      SDK now finds correct 3 games (100% coverage). FC 24 and FC 25 revenue within 10% tolerance.
      FC 26 underestimated at $335M vs CLI $455M (26% gap) due to overly conservative active-sales-window rule and $67 pricing.
      Evolved rules: estimate from franchise trajectory, use $70 for current-gen-only titles.

      Regression from 83.33% to 37.5%. Problem statement changed from 1990-2026 to 2023-2025, revealing new issues.
      SDK missed FIFA 23 (actively sold in 2023 but released 2022). SDK used $62 blended price instead of $70.
      SDK used 65% player-to-purchaser ratio (too low). Evolved: include actively-sold games, use $70 default, 75-80% ratio.

      Improvement from 37.5% to 54.17%. SDK now includes FIFA 23 but still missing FC 26 (coverage 75%).
      FIFA 23 underestimated at $660M vs $810M (no World Cup boost). FC 25 overestimated at $665M vs $560M (5% GSD decline too conservative).
      Evolved: mandatory end_year title inclusion, World Cup boost rule (20-25% above baseline), stronger underperformance rule (70-80% of prior year).

      Improvement from 54.17% to 62.5%. Full coverage achieved (4/4 games). FIFA 23 now matches perfectly ($810M).
      FC 24 overestimated ($875M vs $770M) — lifecycle bump added on top of player-to-buyer conversion.
      FC 25 overestimated ($665M vs $560M) — used inflated FC 24 base for underperformance calc.
      FC 26 underestimated ($490M vs $665M) — reported copies-to-date instead of full-year projection.
      Evolved: clarified no lifecycle bump after conversion, correct prior-year base, full-year estimation for active titles.
