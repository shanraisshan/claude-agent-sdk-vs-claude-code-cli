      SDK output was generated manually (endpoint not available), so similarity was artificially high.
      Real SDK integration via Agent SDK had not been tested yet — no CLAUDECODE env var issue discovered.

      First real Agent SDK run — fixed CLAUDECODE nested session blocker and mcp_servers config.
      SDK overestimated copies sold for FC 24/25/26 due to conflating "players" with purchasers; added conservative estimation rules.

      SDK now finds correct 3 games (100% coverage). FC 24 and FC 25 revenue within 10% tolerance.
      FC 26 underestimated at $335M vs CLI $455M (26% gap) due to overly conservative active-sales-window rule and $67 pricing.
      Evolved rules: estimate from franchise trajectory, use $70 for current-gen-only titles.

      Regression from 83.33% to 37.5%. Problem statement changed from 1990-2026 to 2023-2025, revealing new issues.
      SDK missed FIFA 23 (actively sold in 2023 but released 2022). SDK used $62 blended price instead of $70.
      SDK used 65% player-to-purchaser ratio (too low). Evolved: include actively-sold games, use $70 default, 75-80% ratio.

      Improvement from 37.5% to 54.17%. SDK now includes FIFA 23 but still missing FC 26 (coverage 75%).
      FIFA 23 underestimated at $660M vs $810M (no World Cup boost). FC 25 overestimated at $665M vs $560M (5% GSD decline too conservative).
      Evolved: mandatory end_year title inclusion, World Cup boost rule (20-25% above baseline), stronger underperformance rule (70-80% of prior year).

      Improvement from 54.17% to 62.5%. Full coverage achieved (4/4 games). FIFA 23 now matches perfectly ($810M).
      FC 24 overestimated ($875M vs $770M) — lifecycle bump added on top of player-to-buyer conversion.
      FC 25 overestimated ($665M vs $560M) — used inflated FC 24 base for underperformance calc.
      FC 26 underestimated ($490M vs $665M) — reported copies-to-date instead of full-year projection.
      Evolved: clarified no lifecycle bump after conversion, correct prior-year base, full-year estimation for active titles.

      Full convergence achieved. All 4 games matched with 100% coverage. All revenue values within 10% tolerance:
      FIFA 23 ($810M vs $780M, 3.7% diff), FC 24 ($770M vs $770M, 0%), FC 25 ($560M vs $560M, 0%), FC 26 ($665M vs $630M, 5.26% diff).
      Previous iteration's evolution fixes (no lifecycle bump, correct base, full-year estimation) resolved all discrepancies.

      Regression from 100% to 50%. Coverage still 100% (4/4 games). All revenue estimates overestimated by 29-46%.
      SDK used prescriptive formulas (World Cup boost, player-to-copies conversion, underperformance percentages) that
      systematically inflate above CLI's data-driven approach. Evolved: stripped all prescriptive formulas, adopted
      CLI's minimalist rules — be conservative, derive from Reddit data, err on lower side.

      Score unchanged at 50%. SDK includes extra FIFA 23 (released 2022, outside 2023-2025 range).
      Revenue systematically underestimated: FC 24 ($520M vs $715M, -27%), FC 25 ($292.5M vs $525M, -44%),
      FC 26 ($280M vs $490M, -43%). Root cause: SDK workflow still had extra conservative rules (players≠copies,
      err on lower side, substantial decline) that CLI does NOT have. Evolved: made SDK workflow an exact copy
      of CLI — only rule is "revenue = copy sales only". Fixed spawn prompt to match CLI exactly.

      Score improved slightly from 50% to 58.33%. Coverage dropped to 66.67% — SDK missed FIFA 23 and included FC 26
      (CLI includes FIFA 23 but not FC 26). Of matched games, FC 24 was within 10% threshold but FC 25 was 17.65% off.
      Root cause: SDK workflow still had prescriptive rules ($70 pricing, 35-40% player discount, release-year-only filtering)
      that crept back despite iteration 10 strip. Evolved: fully stripped ALL prescriptive rules to match CLI word-for-word.
