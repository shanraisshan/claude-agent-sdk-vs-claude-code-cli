## Notes on Search Limitations
- r/FIFA subreddit returned error: "Cannot access r/FIFA - it may be private, quarantined, or doesn't exist" -- the sub appears to have been migrated to r/EASportsFC
- Reddit search did NOT return many direct FIFA copy sales figures posts. Most FIFA-related posts on Reddit discuss gameplay, Ultimate Team mechanics, microtransactions, and EA controversies rather than copy sales numbers.
- The most useful sales data was found indirectly through EA earnings discussions, franchise comparison posts, and rebrand/underperformance news.

# SECTION 3: PER-GAME SUMMARY - FIFA FRANCHISE RELEASES AND SALES DATA

Based on all Reddit searches conducted, here is the comprehensive list of FIFA titles from 1990-2026 and whatever copy sales data was found on Reddit.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Reddit proved to be a very limited source for specific per-title copy sales figures for the FIFA franchise. EA historically does not release granular per-title unit sales for FIFA games, instead reporting revenue figures that combine copy sales with microtransaction/Ultimate Team revenue.

# SECTION 6: ANALYSIS NOTES

## Why Reddit Has Limited FIFA Sales Data

1. **EA does not publicly report per-title unit sales**: EA reports financial results in terms of revenue (combining copy sales + microtransactions), not unit sales. This means specific "copies sold" figures for individual FIFA titles are rarely available and even more rarely discussed on Reddit.

2. **FIFA Ultimate Team dominates discussion**: The vast majority of FIFA/EA FC discussion on Reddit centers around Ultimate Team gameplay, pack prices, and microtransactions rather than copy sales figures.

3. **Annual release fatigue**: Because FIFA is an annual release, individual titles rarely generate the kind of "milestone" sales announcement posts that other games get (e.g., "X has sold Y million copies!"). The franchise just keeps selling.

4. **r/FIFA subreddit inaccessible**: The original r/FIFA subreddit appears to have been migrated to r/EASportsFC, and the search returned an error when trying to access it directly.

5. **Image-based data**: Several potentially useful posts (Best Selling Franchises chart, NPD data chart) contain sales data in image format that cannot be extracted as text through the Reddit API.

## Key Observations from Reddit

- FIFA/EA FC has been one of the consistently best-selling game franchises globally for over 30 years
- The franchise generates more revenue from microtransactions (FIFA Ultimate Team) than from copy sales since at least 2019
- The rebrand from FIFA to EA Sports FC (starting with FC 24 in 2023) coincided with declining sales performance
- EA Sports FC 25 (2024) was a significant underperformer, contributing to EA losing $6 billion in market value
- EA Sports FC 26 (2025) continued the trend of declining relative performance, losing UK and European launch charts to competitors
- The FIFA licensing deal cost EA $150M/year; FIFA wanted $250M/year, leading to the split
