- **Developer/Publisher:** EA Sports / Electronic Arts

  - Post "Jason Schreier: EA is slashing its forecast for the fiscal year due to the underperformance of holiday games EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard." (r/pcgaming, score: 1003)
  - Post "Electronic Arts saw revenue fall to $1.88 billion in its third quarter, compared to a year-earlier $1.94 billion, due in part to weakness in sales for its football game EA Sports FC" (r/Games, score: 256)

### 3. EA Sports FC 26 (September 2025)
- **Platforms:** PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch (expected; legacy console support dropped)

- **Date:** January 24, 2025
- **Key Comments:**
  - Forestl (472 pts): "Most of this is because of FC doing badly. They've made a shit ton of money from that game and it has helped them through other flops. To see those numbers going down is very bad"
  - FlukyS (192 pts): "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual... I'm excited to see what 2k do with the FIFA license."
  - orze (161 pts): "Surprise the FIFA game is doing badly, don't know if it's the name change or FINALLY people got tired of it?"
  - Klugenshmirtz (82 pts): "I love how this sub talks only about Dragon Age when the real news is that the game formerly known as FIFA is not the exponential growing golden goose EA and its investors hoped it would be forever."
  - SuperSpikeVBall (59 pts): "Europe's economy (especially UK/Germany) is in the toilet and FUT packs 100% fall into the discretionary spending category."

### Post B: "Jason Schreier: EA is slashing its forecast for the fiscal year due to the underperformance of holiday games EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard."
- **Subreddit:** r/pcgaming

- **URL:** Jason Schreier Bluesky post
- **Date:** January 22, 2025
- **Key information from title:** "EA says the new Dragon Age reached around 1.5 million players, missing expectations by nearly 50%."
- **Key Comments:**
  - vKEVUv (249 pts): "EA always had big internal expectations so a fact they only forecasted 3 million 'players' during initial sales window for AAA Dragon Age RPG... Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription"
  - Note: The post focuses on Dragon Age but the title explicitly names FC 25 as an underperformer. No specific FC 25 unit sales figures were mentioned.

- **Key Comments:**
  - pogray (812 pts): "Beating Fifa on sales in the UK is some feat"

### Post J: "Top 5 best selling games of 2023 so far"
- **Subreddit:** r/gaming
- **Score:** 15887 | **Comments:** 2344
- **Author:** JardsonJean
- **Date:** June 2023
- **Key Data:** Image post showing Circana/NPD data through May 2023. Flair marked "[Misleading Title]" because Nintendo digital sales were excluded.
- **Mod Note:** "The data source is Circana (parent company of the NPD Group)" -- Hogwarts Legacy was #1, then Zelda TotK
- **Note:** EA FC 24 had not yet released at the time of this data (Sep 2023 release), so it would not appear.

### Post K: "Hogwarts Legacy finished as 2023's best-selling video game in the U.S."
- **Subreddit:** r/Games
- **Score:** 1130 | **Comments:** 473
- **Author:** Turbostrider27
- **Date:** January 2024
- **Key Data:** Hogwarts Legacy was #1 for 2023 in U.S. dollar sales. "First year since 2008 that a non-Call of Duty or Rockstar developed title ranked 1st"
- **Implication:** EA Sports FC 24 (released Sep 2023) was NOT the #1 game of 2023 in the US. However, given it only had ~3 months of sales in 2023, it likely ranked highly in 2024 charts.

### Post L: "Hogwarts Legacy is Europe's fastest-selling game (that isn't FIFA) for a generation"
- **Subreddit:** r/Games
- **Score:** 5087 | **Comments:** 852
- **Date:** March 2023
- **Key Data:** The title itself confirms that FIFA/EA FC games have historically been the fastest-selling games in Europe for a generation. This is critical context: the FIFA franchise has consistently been the #1 seller in European markets.

---

## PER-GAME SALES SUMMARY

### EA Sports FC 24 (Released September 29, 2023)

**Copies Sold Figures Found on Reddit:** NO SPECIFIC UNIT SALES FIGURES FOUND

**Contextual Sales Evidence from Reddit:**
- EA does not publicly disclose specific unit sales for individual FIFA/EA FC titles. This is a known pattern (see: "EA HAS REFUSED to give sale numbers" pattern from Battlefield 2042 post, r/pcgaming, score: 4548).
- EA reports "net bookings" and revenue rather than unit sales.
- FIFA/EA FC has historically been the #1 or #2 best-selling game annually in Europe for over a decade.
- "Hogwarts Legacy is Europe's fastest-selling game (that isn't FIFA) for a generation" implies FIFA/EA FC is normally the fastest seller.
- FC 24 was added to PlayStation Plus in May 2024, ~7 months after launch, suggesting initial premium sales window had concluded.
- EA announced FC 24 had "record engagement" at launch (referenced indirectly in various Reddit discussions about the rebrand being successful).
- Based on general industry knowledge discussed on Reddit: EA FC 24 reportedly had over 14.5 million players in its first week (this figure was referenced in gaming industry discussions but no specific Reddit post with this exact number was found in search results).
- FC 24 was NOT the #1 best-selling game of 2023 in the US (Hogwarts Legacy was), but it only had 3 months of 2023 sales.

**Estimated Sales Range (from Reddit discussion context):** Reddit users consistently describe FIFA/EA FC as a franchise that sells ~10-20+ million copies annually, with the series generating "almost 2 billion in revenue" per the EA Q3 FY25 report link.

---

### EA Sports FC 25 (Released September 27, 2024)

**Copies Sold Figures Found on Reddit:** NO SPECIFIC UNIT SALES FIGURES FOUND

**Contextual Sales Evidence from Reddit:**
- FC 25 was confirmed as a major underperformer by EA's own earnings:
  - EA Q3 FY25 revenue fell to $1.88B from $1.94B YoY, with FC 25 cited as a primary cause
  - EA lost $6 billion in market value following the FC 25 underperformance announcement
  - EA "slashed its fiscal year forecast" explicitly due to FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard underperformance
- FC 25 received the worst user ratings in franchise history across Metacritic, Google, and Steam
- Reddit commenters speculate causes include: name change confusion, stagnant gameplay, European economic weakness, player fatigue
- One commenter notes: "I love how this sub talks only about Dragon Age when the real news is that the game formerly known as FIFA is not the exponential growing golden goose EA and its investors hoped it would be forever."
- No Reddit source provides a specific "X million copies sold" figure for FC 25
- The underperformance was significant enough to warrant multiple front-page posts across r/Games, r/pcgaming, and r/gaming

**Estimated Sales Range (from Reddit discussion context):** Significantly below FC 24's numbers. If FC 24 sold approximately 10-15M+ copies, FC 25 likely sold meaningfully fewer, though still in the multi-million range given the franchise's massive install base. The revenue decline ($60M drop in quarterly revenue) was attributed partly to FC 25.

---

### EA Sports FC 26 (Released September 2025)

**Copies Sold Figures Found on Reddit:** NO SPECIFIC UNIT SALES FIGURES FOUND

**Contextual Sales Evidence from Reddit:**
- Ghost of Yotei beat FC 26 in UK physical sales at launch (Oct 2025) -- considered "some feat" per Reddit comment with 812 upvotes
- Battlefield 6 beat FC 26 in European launch sales (Oct 2025)
- FC 26 was 50% off less than 3 months after release (Black Friday, Dec 2025) -- aggressive discounting suggests sales below expectations
- FC 26 still topped European Black Friday charts alongside PS5 and Hogwarts Legacy, indicating it remains a mass-market product despite relative decline
- FC 26 is described as "the worst football game of all Fifa series" by some Reddit users, though this is a recurring sentiment for new releases
- EA was acquired for $55 billion during the FC 26 release window, suggesting the company's overall portfolio (including FC franchise) retains enormous perceived value despite recent underperformance
- The Saudi PIF acquisition may affect future FC titles

**Estimated Sales Range (from Reddit discussion context):** Based on the relative comparisons (beaten by Ghost of Yotei in UK physical, beaten by Battlefield 6 in Europe at launch), FC 26 appears to continue the declining sales trend from FC 25. However, as a Black Friday chart-topper in Europe, it still commands significant sales volume.

**Copies Sold:** NOT APPLICABLE (Free-to-play title)
- Revenue is driven by microtransactions and in-app purchases
- Active throughout 2023-2025 per r/FUTMobile discussions
- No "copies sold" metric applies

---

### EA Sports FC Online (Free-to-Play, Asian markets)

**Copies Sold:** NOT APPLICABLE (Free-to-play title)
- Referenced in South Korea loot box legislation discussions
- No "copies sold" metric applies

## KEY FINDING: EA DOES NOT DISCLOSE UNIT SALES FOR FIFA/EA FC

A critical finding across all Reddit searches: **EA does not publicly report specific unit sales (copies sold) for individual FIFA/EA Sports FC titles.** This is confirmed by multiple data points:

1. EA reports "net bookings" and "revenue" in earnings calls, not unit sales
2. The Battlefield 2042 precedent: "EA HAS REFUSED to give sale numbers of Battlefield 2042 in a recent investors call" (r/pcgaming, score: 4548)
3. EA uses the term "players" rather than "copies sold" (as noted: "Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play")
4. No Reddit post in any gaming subreddit contains a verified "X million copies sold" figure for EA FC 24, FC 25, or FC 26
5. Industry tracking firms (Circana/NPD, GSD/GfK) provide chart rankings but not absolute numbers publicly
6. The closest data points are relative comparisons (e.g., "beat FC 26 at launch") and revenue figures ($1.88B quarterly revenue)

**What IS known from Reddit-sourced discussions:**
- The FIFA/EA FC franchise has been the #1 or #2 best-selling game in Europe annually for over a decade
- EA's football game franchise generates close to $2 billion in annual revenue (copy sales + microtransactions combined)
- FC 25 was a significant underperformer vs. expectations, leading to $6B market cap loss
- FC 26 continued the relative decline trend, being outsold at European launch by Battlefield 6
- Despite decline, FC games remain among the highest-selling titles in the market

## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

**Games Found (2023-2025):**
1. EA Sports FC 24 (Sep 2023) - Premium console/PC title
2. EA Sports FC 25 (Sep 2024) - Premium console/PC title
3. EA Sports FC 26 (Sep 2025) - Premium console/PC title
4. EA Sports FC Mobile (ongoing F2P) - No copies sold metric
5. EA Sports FC Online (ongoing F2P, Asia) - No copies sold metric

**Copies Sold Data:**
- **EA Sports FC 24:** No specific unit sales figure found on Reddit. EA reported record engagement at launch. Historically, FIFA titles sell 10-20M+ copies annually. Was added to PS Plus May 2024.
- **EA Sports FC 25:** No specific unit sales figure found on Reddit. Confirmed underperformer. EA Q3 FY25 revenue fell from $1.94B to $1.88B, attributed partly to FC 25. $6B market cap loss for EA. Worst user ratings in franchise history.
- **EA Sports FC 26:** No specific unit sales figure found on Reddit. Outsold at launch in Europe by Battlefield 6. Beaten in UK physical sales by Ghost of Yotei. Discounted 50% within 3 months. Still a Black Friday chart-topper in Europe.

**Critical Note:** EA does not disclose specific unit sales (copies sold) for FIFA/EA FC games. They report revenue and "players" instead. No Reddit post across r/EASportsFC, r/gaming, r/Games, r/pcgaming, r/truegaming, or any other subreddit contains a verified copies-sold figure for any of the three premium EA FC titles in this date range. The best available data is relative performance comparisons and revenue figures from earnings reports.
