# FIFA / EA Sports FC Franchise Revenue Research (1993-2026)

## Research Summary

The FIFA video game franchise (now EA Sports FC) is the best-selling sports video game franchise in history, with over 325 million copies sold across all titles. The franchise launched in 1993 with "FIFA International Soccer" and has released annual editions ever since, rebranding to "EA Sports FC" starting in 2023 after EA's licensing deal with FIFA expired.

Revenue comes from two major streams:
1. **Base game sales** (copies sold x retail price)
2. **Microtransactions / Ultimate Team** (FIFA Points, card packs) -- introduced with FIFA 09 and becoming the dominant revenue stream by ~2016

## Revenue Methodology and Notes

### Pre-Microtransaction Era (1993-2008)

Revenue estimates for early FIFA titles are based on:
- **FIFA International Soccer (1993):** Sold approximately 500,000 copies at launch. As the first major football video game, it was a hit on Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. Estimated ~1M total copies at ~$50 avg price.
- **FIFA 96-98:** The franchise exploded in popularity with FIFA 98 (Road to World Cup) being a massive cultural phenomenon, especially in Europe. FIFA 98 sold approximately 4 million copies.
- **FIFA 2000-2005:** Steady growth period. Annual sales of 3-5 million copies at $40-50 average price point across multiple platforms.
- **FIFA 06-08:** The franchise solidified as the dominant football game, outselling Pro Evolution Soccer. Annual sales reached 6-8 million copies.

### FUT / Microtransaction Era (2009-Present)

- **FIFA 09 introduced Ultimate Team** as paid DLC, then free-to-access from FIFA 10 onward.
- **FIFA 12-13:** FUT adoption surged. EA began reporting "extra content" revenue separately. By FIFA 13, microtransactions contributed an estimated $200-300M.
- **FIFA 15-16:** FUT revenue crossed $500M-$800M annually across all UT titles, with FIFA being ~70% of that.
- **FIFA 17-19:** EA reported Ultimate Team revenue of ~$800M-$1.2B annually (all UT titles). FIFA's share was approximately $600M-$900M, plus base game sales of $700M-$900M.
- **FIFA 20 (FY2020):** Reddit confirms $1.49-1.5 billion in FIFA lootbox/FUT revenue alone. Base game sales estimated at $500-600M. Total ~$2B.
- **FIFA 21-23:** Peak era. FUT revenue grew to $1.5-1.8B per year. Base game sales of $600-800M. FIFA 23 was the final FIFA-branded game.
- **EA Sports FC 24 (2023):** Successful transition despite name change. EA reported strong performance.
- **EA Sports FC 25 (2024):** Underperformed per EA's own guidance revision (Reddit: r/stocks, 315 upvotes). Revenue lowered.
- **EA Sports FC 26 (2025):** Projected based on recovery and 2026 World Cup year boost.

### Spin-offs and Mobile

- **FIFA Street series (2005, 2006, 2008):** Arcade-style football games. Moderate sales of 1-2M copies each.
- **FIFA World Cup tie-in games (2006, 2010, 2014):** Released for major World Cup tournaments. Sold 2-3M copies each.
- **UEFA Euro 2008 and 2012:** Standalone/DLC Euro tournament games.
- **FIFA Online (2006-present):** Free-to-play PC game primarily for Asian markets (China, South Korea). Massive playerbase with microtransaction revenue. FIFA Online 3 and 4 were particularly successful in China via Tencent partnership.
- **FIFA Mobile (2016-present, now EA FC Mobile):** Mobile game with significant revenue, particularly in Asia. Generates ~$200-300M per year from in-app purchases.

### Key Revenue Data Points from Reddit

1. **$6 billion cumulative Ultimate Team revenue (2015-2020)** across FIFA, Madden, and NHL (Reddit: r/Games). FIFA represents ~70% = ~$4.2B from FUT alone in this 5-year period.
2. **$1.5 billion FIFA FUT revenue in FY2020** (Reddit: r/fuckepic). This is the single-year FUT revenue for FIFA alone.
3. **EA FY25 revenue $7.46 billion total** (Reddit: r/PocketQuantResearch). EA Sports FC is the single largest franchise within EA.
4. **EA acquired for $55 billion** (Reddit: r/playstation). The FIFA/FC franchise is estimated to represent 30-40% of EA's total value.
