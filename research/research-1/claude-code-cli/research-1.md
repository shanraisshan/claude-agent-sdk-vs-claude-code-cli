# FIFA / EA Sports FC - Complete Game Releases and Revenue Research

## Research Summary

This research catalogs every known FIFA and EA Sports FC branded video game release from 1993 through EA Sports FC 26 (2025), including main series titles, FIFA Street, FIFA Online, FIFA Mobile, and other spin-offs. Revenue estimates are derived from Reddit community discussions referencing EA financial reports, industry analyses, and community-verified figures.

### Key Findings

- **Total games identified:** 56 distinct titles across all sub-series
- **Franchise lifespan:** 1993-2025 (32 years)
- **Main series:** FIFA International Soccer (1993) through EA Sports FC 26 (2025) = 33 annual releases
- **Spin-offs:** 4 FIFA Street games, 4 FIFA Online games, FIFA Mobile, FIFA Manager series, World Cup games, and others
- **Revenue trajectory:** From ~$50M/year (1990s) to $2B+/year (2020s)
- **FUT (FIFA Ultimate Team):** Introduced in FIFA 09, became dominant revenue source. $1.62B alone in FY2021, ~$1.71B by FY2024
- **Total estimated franchise lifetime revenue:** ~$35-40 billion (including all game sales, FUT, mobile, and live services)
- **EA was acquired for $55 billion in 2025** by PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners -- the FIFA/FC franchise was a key driver of that valuation

### Revenue Methodology Notes

- **Pre-FUT era (1993-2008):** Estimates based on copies sold x average retail price. FIFA typically sold 3-10 million copies per year in this era. Retail prices ranged from $40-$60.
- **FUT era (2009-present):** Includes base game sales + Ultimate Team microtransactions + DLC + live services. FUT became larger than base game sales by ~2019.
- **Key EA financial reference points (from Reddit-sourced data):**
  - FY2018: EA live services revenue ~$2.2B total (FUT primary)
  - FY2020: FIFA lootbox revenue ~$1.49B
  - FY2021: Ultimate Team revenue ~$1.62B
  - FY2022: 71% of EA total revenue from live services
  - FY2024: FUT revenue ~$1.71B
  - FY2025: EA Sports FC franchise generating "almost $2 billion in revenue"
  - FIFA org demanded $1B per 4-year cycle for naming rights; EA was paying ~$150M previously
  - FC 25 underperformed, leading to $6B market cap loss for EA
