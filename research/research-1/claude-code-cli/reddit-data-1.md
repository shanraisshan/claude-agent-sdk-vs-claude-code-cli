## Sales Data from Reddit Sources

### EA Sports FC 24 (2023)

**Key Reddit Sources:**
- r/gamernews post (score: 116): "14.5m people played EA Sports FC its first month" — EA reported 14.5 million players in the first month, but "players" includes EA Play trial users and Game Pass subscribers, not just copy sales.
- Reddit discussions across r/EASportsFC and r/Games noted EA deliberately switched from reporting "copies sold" to "players" to inflate perceived numbers.
- Prior FIFA titles (FIFA 23) had reported 10.3 million copies sold in first week. FC 24's actual copy sales estimated lower due to EA Play/Game Pass inclusion in "player" counts.

**Estimated Copy Sales:**
- First month: ~6-8 million copies (extrapolated from 14.5M "players" minus EA Play/Game Pass subscribers)
- Lifetime estimate: ~12-15 million copies
- Confidence: Medium

- r/EASportsFC post (score: 516): "EA FC 25 is probably the least effort EA has ever put in"
- r/EASportsFC post (score: 1,336): Satirical "Thank you EA sports and FC 25 for changing my life" — player expressing frustration by thanking EA for making them stop caring about the franchise.

## Key Observations from Reddit Discussions

1. **Rebrand Impact:** The FIFA → EA Sports FC transition was widely discussed. EA retained most of its playerbase due to exclusive league licenses, but brand recognition took a hit.

2. **"Players" vs "Copies Sold":** EA switched from reporting unit sales to reporting "players" (which inflates numbers via EA Play and Game Pass trials). This was a recurring complaint across r/EASportsFC, r/Games, and r/pcgaming.

3. **FC 25 Underperformance:** The most significant finding — FC 25 significantly underperformed, contributing to EA losing $6B in market value. EA slashed its fiscal year forecast. Jason Schreier confirmed the underperformance.

4. **FC 25 Revenue Record Paradox:** Despite lower unit sales, FC 25's launch month broke revenue records for soccer games in the US, likely due to higher pricing tiers (Ultimate Edition) and microtransaction spending. However, this research focuses on copy sales only.

5. **FC 26 Recovery:** FC 26 was the top-selling game during Black Friday 2025 in Europe, suggesting some recovery from FC 25's underperformance.

6. **EA Acquisition:** During the FC 26 lifecycle, EA was acquired for $55 billion, marking a major corporate event for the franchise.
