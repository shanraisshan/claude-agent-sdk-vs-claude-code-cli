## Section 4: Franchise-Level Sales Data from Reddit

### Total Franchise Sales
- The "Best Selling Video Game Franchises Ever" infographic post (r/gaming, 1pqlorv, 2025) included FIFA but the infographic is an image and specific numbers were not text-extractable.
- One commenter noted: "Feels weird tracking Fifa and not including EA Sports FC after they let the naming rights lapse." -- implying the infographic only tracked the FIFA-branded entries, not the EA Sports FC continuation.
- No Reddit post provided a specific total franchise sales number (commonly cited elsewhere as ~325 million copies across all FIFA-branded games).

### Key Franchise-Level Insights from Reddit:
1. **FIFA 13 is the only title with solid Reddit-sourced sales data:** 14.5 million copies per EA's official FY13 results (r/Games post 1dvvz0)
2. **FIFA 12 implied to have sold >10 million copies** (r/Games post 11780i)
3. **FIFA 18 sold 2.7 million in the UK alone** (physical + digital) (r/EASportsFC post ac4ccd)
4. **FIFA 19 sold 2.5 million in the UK alone** (physical + digital), decline from FIFA 18 (r/EASportsFC post ac4ccd)
5. **FIFA games have been Europe's fastest-selling games "for a generation"** per r/Games post about Hogwarts Legacy (11ky1mc)
6. **The franchise was nearly never created** because EA executives thought nobody would care about a soccer game (r/Games post 1kr9rw)
7. **EA Sports FC 26 was outsold by Ghost of Yotei** in UK launch-week physical sales (r/gaming post 1nzc677) -- suggesting potential decline in physical sales for the post-FIFA-branded era
8. **EA paid approximately $150M/year for FIFA naming rights** before the $1 billion demand led to the rebrand (r/Games post q7tnmc)

## Section 5: Data Gaps and Limitations

Reddit proved to be a limited source for FIFA copy sales data specifically. The key issues:

1. **FIFA/EA Sports FC sales figures are rarely discussed on Reddit** -- unlike indie games or single-player titles that celebrate sales milestones, EA does not publicly trumpet individual FIFA title sales frequently.
2. **EA stopped reporting individual title unit sales** in their earnings reports after a certain period, making it harder for Reddit users to cite specific numbers.
3. **The r/FIFA subreddit is private** (now r/EASportsFC), which may have contained historical sales discussions that are no longer searchable.
4. **Pre-2010 FIFA games** have essentially zero Reddit discussion of their sales figures, as Reddit was not widely used during those releases.
5. **The strongest data found was for FIFA 13** (14.5M from EA's official report) and **FIFA 18/19 UK-only data** (2.7M and 2.5M respectively).
6. **No Reddit post provided a comprehensive per-title breakdown** of FIFA franchise sales. Such data typically appears on Wikipedia, VGChartz, or industry analyst reports rather than Reddit discussions.
