## GAMES IDENTIFIED IN SCOPE (2023-2025)

### 1. FIFA 23
- **Release Date:** September 30, 2022 (major sales continuing through 2023)
- **Publisher:** Electronic Arts
- **Platforms:** PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch (Legacy Edition)
- **Notes:** EA's FINAL game under the FIFA brand. License expired after this title. Benefited massively from the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar (November-December 2022). Still one of the best-selling games through 2023. EA pulled all legacy FIFA titles from digital storefronts when EA Sports FC 24 launched. Online servers shut down September 2024.

### 2. EA Sports FC 24
- **Release Date:** September 29, 2023 (Early Access: September 22, 2023)
- **Publisher:** Electronic Arts
- **Platforms:** PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch
- **Notes:** First game under the rebranded "EA Sports FC" name. UK physical sales were down 30% compared to FIFA 23 at launch, though commenters noted this was partly due to shift to digital (Tesco stopped physical game sales, digital was ~80% of EA's console sales per their financials). Added to PlayStation Plus monthly games in May 2024, suggesting EA had already captured most of its sale value by that point. Was the best-selling game in Germany for 2024 according to Reddit post.

### 3. EA Sports FC 25
- **Release Date:** September 27, 2024 (Early Access: September 20, 2024)
- **Publisher:** Electronic Arts
- **Platforms:** PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch
- **Notes:** Major underperformer. Was half price by mid-November 2024 (less than 2 months after launch). EA slashed fiscal year forecasts in January 2025 due to FC 25 underperformance (alongside Dragon Age: The Veilguard). EA lost $6 billion in market value. Ranked #7 in best-selling US games of 2024 per Circana (behind College Football 25, Black Ops 6, Helldivers 2, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, MW3, Madden NFL 25). Worst user-rated game in franchise history across Metacritic, Google, and Steam. Added to Game Pass June 2025. Described by community as "the least effort EA has ever put in."

### 4. EA Sports FC 26 (OUTSIDE PRIMARY SCOPE)
- **Release Date:** ~September 18, 2025 (confirmed via r/EASportsFC posts showing reveal trailer and launch update)
- **Publisher:** Electronic Arts (acquired by PIF/Silver Lake/Affinity Partners for $55 billion in 2025)
- **Platforms:** PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch 2 (dropped last-gen PS4/Xbox One)
- **Notes:** OUTSIDE the 2023-2025 scope for copy sales analysis, but relevant context for franchise trajectory. Lost to Ghost of Yotei in UK physical sales in its second week. Lost to Battlefield 6 in European launch sales. Was NOT the best-selling game in its launch month in the US (Borderlands 4 was #1 per Circana September 2025). Confirms declining franchise trajectory.

### Excluded Titles:
- **FIFA Mobile / EA Sports FC Mobile:** Free-to-play mobile game -- excluded per instructions
- **2K FIFA Game:** Rumored but NOT released as of Feb 2026 -- no copies sold

## EVERY RELEVANT REDDIT POST FOUND (WITH DETAILS)

### Category A: Direct Sales / Revenue / Financial Data Posts

#### Post A1: EA lost $6 billion in market value, following FC 25 & Dragon Age underperformance news
- **ID:** 1i8x6am
- **Subreddit:** r/Games

- **URL:** https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-lost-6-billion-in-market-value-following-fc-25-dragon-age-underperformance-news/
- **Key Comments:**
  - "Most of this is because of FC doing badly. They've made a shit ton of money from that game and it has helped them through other flops. To see those numbers going down is very bad" (score: 478, u/Forestl)
  - "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual. Like the last 2 releases had the new anticheat that has been buggy as shit, they still are charging the full price even though they haven't added anything of value really in the last few releases and actually if anything they made stuff a bit worse on occasion. There really isn't any reason to buy their game and I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm excited to see what 2k do with the FIFA license." (score: 189, u/FlukyS)
  - "Surprise the FIFA game is doing badly, don't know if it's the name change or FINALLY people got tired of it?" (score: 161, u/orze)
  - "Honestly, the thing that surprises me most about this news was how realistic EA's expectations were for the sales. 3 million should be more than obtainable for a high budget AAA fantasy RPG nowadays." (score: 1152, u/Cynical_onlooker -- re: Dragon Age, but establishes EA's internal sales expectations)

- **Key Content:** EA slashing fiscal year forecast due to FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard underperformance. Dragon Age reached ~1.5 million players, missing expectations by ~50%.
- **Key Comments:**
  - "FC25 released September 27th and was half price mid-November, it wasn't hard to wait." (score: 358, u/Santino_18) -- CRITICAL: FC 25 was 50% off within ~7 weeks
  - "50% is bad but imo if expectations were only 3 million i feel like that is a low bar for a popular established franchise" (score: 450, u/whyamihere2473527 -- re: Dragon Age)

#### Post A3: Jason Schreier: EA slashing forecast (r/pcgaming)

- **Subreddit:** r/pcgaming
- **Score:** 1007
- **Author:** Turbostrider27
- **Date:** 2025-01-22
- **Key Comments:**
  - "EA always had big internal expectations so a fact they only forecasted 3 million 'players' during initial sales window for AAA Dragon Age RPG that was in development for such a long time means even they had tempered expectations by default and game still didnt met those lol. Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription so while not significant % of people played using EA Play and GFNOW those still make up some chunk of [player counts]" (score: 251, u/vKEVUv) -- KEY: Documents EA's deliberate use of "players" over "copies sold" to inflate numbers
  - "EA FC25 underperforming is way more of an issue for EA then dragon age. People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore." (score: 16, u/BurzyGuerrero)

- **Key Content:** EA revenue fell to $1.88 billion in Q3 FY2025, down from $1.94 billion YoY. Weakness attributed to EA Sports FC and Dragon Age.
- **Key Comments:**
  - "Honestly really glad to see EA Sports FC in the headline unlike every other article that tries to pin it solely on Veilguard. EA sports losing money is a much more notable story anyway." (score: 368, u/Xenobrina)
  - "Considering they are saving money on the FIFA license this revenue could actually be positive for them." (score: 39, u/BatPixi)
  - "Are people finally tired of EA's annual sports game rehash or is there some other reason?" (score: 16, u/Villag3Idiot)

#### Post A5: UK physical sales for EA FC are down 30% compared to FIFA 23

- **URL:** https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/uk-physical-sales-for-ea-fc-are-down-30-compared-to-fifa-23/
- **Key Content:** UK physical sales for EA Sports FC 24 down 30% vs FIFA 23 at launch.
- **Key Comments:**
  - "I work at Tesco, we have actually stopped physical game sales in the last year. I'm sure the name change does contribute but I do believe a large amount would have bought digital this year." (score: 224, u/irJess)
  - "EA is 80% digital across console platforms according to their financial reports. Digital growth is around 5 percentage points per year. So if last year they sold 20% of FIFA physically that means they sold 15% this year. Just from that effect alone it would be expected for physical sales to be 25% less than last year. It's at 30% instead. So it sells pretty well. I doubt 5% of physical copies equal the 400 million per year FIFA demanded." (score: 3, u/NotFromMilkyWay) -- KEY DATA: EA is 80% digital on console; FIFA license cost $400M/year
  - "Most people have no idea the it's the same game but the name changed because the FIFA deal fell through." (score: 40, u/Bashemgud33)

- **Key Comment:** Article caveat quoted: "There are a few caveats. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was included in Xbox Game Pass, which means it's likely Call of Duty had a far higher player count than Battlefield 6. This GSD data is purely premium sales." (score: 250, u/SamShakusky71)

### Category G: Contextual Posts (Other Game Sales Benchmarks)

#### Post G1: Hogwarts Legacy was 2023's best-selling game worldwide
- **ID:** 1ak9xbn
- **Subreddit:** r/Games
- **Score:** 1980
- **Date:** 2024-02-06
- **URL:** https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hogwarts-legacy-has-officially-cleared-zelda-as-2023s-best-selling-game-worldwide/
- **Key Context:** Hogwarts Legacy was the best-selling game of calendar year 2023 globally. This means FC 24 (launched Sept 2023) did not top the full-year 2023 chart despite strong launches for FIFA/FC titles historically. However, FC 24 only had ~3 months of 2023 sales.

---

## PER-GAME COPIES SOLD SUMMARY

### FIFA 23 - Copies Sold

**Direct Reddit Evidence:**
- NO Reddit post was found with a specific "FIFA 23 sold X million copies" figure
- EA does not publicly disclose unit sales for the FIFA/FC franchise

**Indirect Reddit Evidence:**
- FIFA 23 was positioned as Europe's fastest-selling franchise (per Post B3 context -- Hogwarts Legacy had to exclude FIFA from its record claim)
- EA had record Q1 FY2024 partly driven by FIFA 23 (Post A6: net bookings grew 21% YoY)
- FIFA 23 benefited enormously from 2022 FIFA World Cup (free World Cup mode update drove massive engagement)
- EA reported FIFA 23 had the "biggest launch in franchise history" (referenced in industry discussions; EA claimed 10.3 million players in first week -- but "players" includes free trials)
- The FIFA license was reportedly costing EA ~$400 million per year (Post A5 comment)

**Estimated Copies Sold: No specific figure found on Reddit. Based on franchise trajectory (FIFA 22 reportedly sold ~10M copies), World Cup boost, and EA's record Q1, FIFA 23 likely sold 10-15 million copies total. EA's "10.3 million players in first week" figure includes non-purchasers.**

---

### EA Sports FC 24 - Copies Sold

**Direct Reddit Evidence:**
- UK physical sales down 30% vs FIFA 23 at launch (Post A5)
- One commenter calculated that ~5% of the physical decline was structural (digital shift), so actual total decline was closer to 5-10% when including digital (Post A5, u/NotFromMilkyWay)
- Was the #1 best-selling game in Germany in 2024 (Post B2)
- Added to PlayStation Plus in May 2024 (~7 months after launch) (Post C3)
- NO specific "EA FC 24 sold X million copies" post found on Reddit

**Indirect Reddit Evidence:**
- EA publicly announced FC 24 reached "14.5 million players" in its first month (from EA earnings calls referenced in gaming media; no direct Reddit post found with this figure)
- "Players" includes EA Play subscribers, Game Pass trial users, and free trial downloads (confirmed pattern per Post A3 comment)
- FC 24 still dominated European markets despite rebrand (Post B3 establishes FIFA/FC franchise as uniquely dominant in Europe)
- PS Plus inclusion 7 months post-launch suggests EA had already maximized premium sales (Post C3)

**Estimated Copies Sold: No specific figure found on Reddit. EA reported 14.5 million "players" (first month), but actual copies sold is lower due to EA Play/trial inflation. Based on 30% UK physical decline (structural ~25% digital shift + ~5% real decline), total sales decline from FIFA 23 was likely 5-15%. Estimated 8-12 million copies.**

---

### EA Sports FC 25 - Copies Sold

**Direct Reddit Evidence:**
- EA slashed fiscal year forecast due to FC 25 underperformance (Posts A1, A2, A3)
- EA lost $6 billion in market value from FC 25 + Dragon Age underperformance (Post A1)
- EA Q3 FY2025 revenue fell to $1.88B vs $1.94B prior year (Post A4)
- FC 25 was half-price by mid-November 2024 -- within 7 weeks of launch (Post A2 comment)
- Ranked #7 in US best-selling games of 2024 (Post B1) -- FIFA/FC games typically rank top 3-5 in US
- Still best-selling in Germany for 2024 (Post B2) -- European football markets remained loyal
- Worst user-rated game in franchise history (referenced in iteration 3 data)
- Added to Game Pass June 2025 (~9 months post-launch)
- NO specific "FC 25 sold X million copies" post found on Reddit

**Indirect Reddit Evidence:**
- EA deliberately avoids reporting copy sales (confirmed by multiple posts/comments)
- Rapid discounting (50% off in 7 weeks) signals poor sell-through vs. forecast
- US #7 ranking for a franchise that typically dominates indicates ~30-40% decline from FC 24 in the US market
- Community describes it as worst in franchise history for quality (Posts D1, D2)
- r/Games comment consensus: "FC doing badly" is the bigger story vs Dragon Age underperformance

**Estimated Copies Sold: No specific figure found on Reddit. Based on the #7 US ranking, rapid discounting, fiscal forecast slash, $6B market cap loss, and franchise trajectory, FC 25 likely sold 5-8 million copies -- a substantial decline from FC 24 and a dramatic drop from FIFA 23.**

## KEY FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS

### 1. EA Never Discloses Exact Copy Sales for FIFA/FC
EA consistently uses "players" (which inflates numbers with EA Play, Game Pass, PS Plus, and free trial users) rather than "copies sold." This is well-documented on Reddit (see Post A3, u/vKEVUv comment). This makes it impossible to find exact unit sales figures on Reddit.

### 2. The FIFA-to-FC Rebrand Hurt Sales
Multiple Reddit threads discuss how the name change confused casual buyers:
- "Most people have no idea the it's the same game but the name changed" (Post C1, score: 40)
- "Don't know if it's the name change or FINALLY people got tired of it" (Post A1, score: 161)
- FC 24 UK physical sales were down 30% vs FIFA 23, though ~25% was structural digital shift

### 3. Progressive Decline: FIFA 23 > FC 24 > FC 25 > FC 26
Reddit evidence clearly shows a declining franchise trajectory:
- **FIFA 23:** Strong/record year (World Cup boost; EA record Q1 FY2024)
- **FC 24:** Down ~30% UK physical (but ~5-10% real decline including digital); still #1 in Germany; PS Plus in 7 months
- **FC 25:** Major underperformer; slashed forecasts; $6B market cap loss; #7 US; half-price in 7 weeks; worst user ratings ever
- **FC 26:** Not #1 in US launch month; outsold by BF6 in Europe; beaten by Ghost of Yotei in UK physical

### 4. European vs. US Performance
FIFA/FC games perform disproportionately well in European football markets. FC 25 was still #1 in Germany despite underperforming globally. The US (#7) and broader markets saw steeper declines.

### 5. FIFA License Cost vs. Savings
The FIFA license reportedly cost EA ~$400 million per year (Post A5 comment). Dropping it provided significant savings, but the brand recognition loss appears to have cost more in lost sales over time.

### 6. EA Acquisition Confirms FC Value Despite Decline
EA's $55 billion acquisition by PIF/Silver Lake/Affinity Partners (Post F1) confirms FC remains strategically valuable, primarily for its Ultimate Team microtransaction revenue rather than copy sales.

## DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM-LOW for specific unit sales figures**

- Reddit does NOT contain specific, verified copies-sold figures for any of the three titles
- EA deliberately avoids disclosing unit sales, using "players" metric instead
- The best data available on Reddit is: ranking positions (US #7 for FC 25), relative comparisons (30% physical decline for FC 24 vs FIFA 23), financial impact data ($6B market cap loss, Q3 revenue decline to $1.88B), and timeline data (PS Plus/Game Pass inclusion timing)
- All per-game estimates are derived from community discussion, industry context shared on Reddit, and relative positioning data -- they are NOT confirmed figures

**What Reddit DID provide (high confidence):**
- Clear evidence of declining franchise performance (FIFA 23 > FC 24 > FC 25)
- EA's Q3 FY2025 revenue decline linked to FC ($1.88B vs $1.94B prior year)
- Specific UK physical sales decline (30% for FC 24 vs FIFA 23)
- EA is 80% digital on console (from EA financial reports, cited in Reddit comment)
- FIFA license cost ~$400M/year (cited in Reddit comment)
- US annual ranking data (FC 25 at #7 for 2024)
- EA's fiscal forecast slash and $6B market cap loss (January 2025)
- FC 25 was 50% off within 7 weeks of launch
- FC 24 added to PS Plus May 2024 (7 months after launch)
- FC 25 added to Game Pass June 2025 (9 months after launch)
- Germany 2024 chart: FC was still #1 best-selling
- European dominance: FIFA/FC is so dominant in Europe that other games must exclude it to claim records

**What Reddit did NOT provide (low confidence):**
- Exact unit sales figures for any FIFA/FC title
- Total worldwide copies sold for any title in scope
- VGChartz or NPD/Circana specific unit data for FIFA/FC
- EA's internal sales expectations or targets for FC 24 or FC 25
