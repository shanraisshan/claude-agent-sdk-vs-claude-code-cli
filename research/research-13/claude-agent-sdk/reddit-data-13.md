- **Date:** January 24, 2025

**Key comment insights:**
- u/Cynical_onlooker (score 1,147): "Honestly, the thing that surprises me most about this news was how realistic EA's expectations were for the sales. 3 million should be more than obtainable for a high budget AAA fantasy RPG nowadays. I do wonder how much more of a leash they're going to give Bioware."
- u/Forestl (score 474): "Most of this is because of FC doing badly. They've made a shit ton of money from that game and it has helped them through other flops. To see those numbers going down is very bad"
- u/FlukyS (score 191): "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual. Like the last 2 releases had the new anticheat that has been buggy as shit, they still are charging the full price even though they haven't added anything of value really in the last few releases... I'm excited to see what 2k do with the FIFA license."
- u/orze (score 159): "Surprise the FIFA game is doing badly, don't know if it's the name change or FINALLY people got tired of it?"

**Key comment insights:**
- u/Crimsonclaw111 (score 603): "Damn they could've at least remade Dead Space 2 and lost money but keep critical acclaim"
- u/vKEVUv (score 246): "EA always had big internal expectations so a fact they only forecasted 3 million 'players' during initial sales window for AAA Dragon Age RPG... Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription"
- u/BurzyGuerrero (score 18): "EA FC25 underperforming is way more of an issue for EA then dragon age. People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore."
- General consensus: FC 25 underperformance was the bigger financial story than Dragon Age: The Veilguard

- u/Gaudious (score 74): "So give or take EA mathematically made more this year than with FIFA last year. Because they're paying less licensing deals, making those deals with the clubs, leagues and players directly"
- u/KingBlueTwister (score 82): "Stop buying this dog shit game, and maybe another company will come along (Not PES) and do it better"

- u/Moistkeano (score 10): "Its no surprise. This is the first year they made a genuinely bad game and the writing was on the wall when they said most games were being played in Rush mode."
- u/PsychologicalApple53 (score 5): "The fact that they made over 1B from a free mobile game is fucking insane." -- Referring to FIFA Mobile/FC Mobile revenue
- u/TheAngryKoalaUK (score 9): "I love the statement they make of 'people aren't playing it as much but there's no significant cause to think that the player base is declining' right next to 'but our monetisation is better than ever!!!!'"

- u/FacelessGreenseer (score 15): "They did bring a lot of people back with the patch that improved gameplay before TOTY. But again they failed to realise... the server capacities. Which were increased and improved to the point where we ALL enjoyed the gameplay during the busiest period of the game, and then after that they went back to their cost cutting methods"
- u/peterpants123 (score 2): "EA is also making money from advertisement board in the game! They are selling pitch side ad-boards just like real football clubs do with the stadium."

## PER-GAME SUMMARY

### EA Sports FC 24 (Released: September 29, 2023)

**Copies Sold / Player Count Data Found on Reddit:**
- **14.5 million players in first month** (Source: r/gamernews post 17mq3a1 linking to pcgamesinsider.biz, November 2023). Note: This is "players" not "copies sold" -- includes EA Play subscribers who had trial access.
- EA reported FC 24 had a successful launch, making more money than FIFA 23 despite dropping the FIFA name, partly because EA saved on the FIFA licensing fee (~$150M/year reportedly).
- The Hogwarts Legacy post (r/Games, March 2023) explicitly confirms FIFA holds the record as Europe's fastest-selling game franchise, with HL being the fastest "that isn't FIFA."
- No specific unit sales number (e.g., "X million copies sold") was found on Reddit for FC 24.
- FC 24 was considered commercially successful by EA and the transition from FIFA branding was viewed as smooth from a business perspective.

**Revenue Context from Reddit:**
- EA FY2024 live services revenue was $5.4 billion out of $7.4 billion total (~73%), with FUT estimated at 60-70% of that (Source: r/EASportsFC post 1i8gjoo)
- This translates to roughly $3.2-3.8 billion from FUT alone
- EA also earns over $1 billion from FIFA/FC Mobile (mentioned in r/EASportsFC post 1i8gjoo comment)

**Estimated copies sold (inferred from Reddit data):** No direct copy sales figure found. The 14.5M player figure in the first month would include some EA Play trial users. Historical FIFA franchise context suggests annual sales typically in the range of 10-15 million copies per title, with FC 24 reportedly performing at or above FIFA 23 levels.

### EA Sports FC 25 (Released: September 27, 2024)

**Copies Sold / Revenue Data Found on Reddit:**
- **Broke US launch revenue record for soccer games** (Source: r/gamernews post 1gb1zth linking to gamesindustry.biz Circana data, October 2024). Note: "Revenue record" likely includes premium/ultimate edition pricing ($100+ editions), not necessarily unit sales record.
- **Underperformed EA's internal expectations** (Source: Multiple Reddit posts from January 2025 -- post 1i7m0ck citing Jason Schreier, post 1i8x6am citing VGC). EA slashed its fiscal year forecast due to FC 25 underperformance.
- **EA lost $6 billion in market value** partly due to FC 25 underperformance (Source: r/Games post 1i8x6am, January 2025)
- **EA Q3 FY2025 revenue fell from $1.94B to $1.88B** partly due to FC weakness (Source: Hollywood Reporter cited in Reddit discussions)
- **EA Q3 FY25 results showed "almost 2 billion in revenue"** from EA Sports segment (Source: r/EASportsFC post 1olq87u referencing https://www.ea.com/news/electronic-arts-reports-q3-fy25-results)
- **#1 best-selling game in Europe, H1 2025** across all 17 tracked countries (Source: VGChartz data cited in r/Games discussions)
- **Worst user-rated game in franchise history** across Metacritic, Google, and Steam (Source: r/EASportsFC post 1n7ixhg)
- No specific unit sales number (e.g., "X million copies sold") was found on Reddit for FC 25.

**Context from Reddit discussions:**
- FC 25 initially broke US launch revenue records but then saw significant decline in ongoing engagement and microtransaction spending
- "People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore" (u/BurzyGuerrero, r/pcgaming, score 18)
- FC 25 was considered a commercial disappointment by EA's standards despite still being Europe's #1 game in H1 2025
- Community consensus: worst FIFA/FC game ever made, driving player exodus
- "This is the first year they made a genuinely bad game" (u/Moistkeano, r/EASportsFC, score 10)

**Estimated copies sold (inferred from Reddit data):** No direct copy sales figure found. The game underperformed EA's expectations but was still the best-selling game in Europe for H1 2025, suggesting it still sold in the multi-million range. The decline in EA's overall revenue and slashed forecast suggests FC 25 sold fewer copies and/or generated less microtransaction revenue than FC 24.

### EA Sports FC 26 (Released: September 2025) -- NOTE: Technically outside strict 2023-2025 release window but data found

**Data Found on Reddit (for context and trend analysis):**
- **FC 26 European launch sales beaten by Battlefield 6** (Source: r/gaming post 1o9atzm, October 2025)
- **FC 26 beaten by Ghost of Yotei in UK physical sales** in its second week (Source: r/PS5 post 1nyu1z1, r/gaming post 1nzc677, October 2025)
- **FC 26 was 50% off less than 3 months from release** at Black Friday 2025 (Source: r/Games discussions)
- **FC 26 Twitch viewership dropped significantly** vs. FC 25 and FC 24
- **FC 26 "Worst User-Rated" designation** continued the FC 25 trend of poor community reception

### Other Titles in Period

**FIFA-branded games (2023-2025):** No new FIFA-branded games were released in this period. EA's last FIFA-branded game was FIFA 23 (released September 2022). From September 2023 onward, the franchise was rebranded to EA Sports FC.

**EA Sports FC Mobile / FIFA Mobile:** Not specifically tracked in Reddit discussions found. The mobile versions operate as live-service titles with continuous updates rather than annual releases with discrete copy sales figures. One Reddit commenter referenced over $1 billion in revenue from the mobile game.

**FIFA (the organization) rival game:** FIFA (the governing body) announced plans to create a rival soccer game after the split with EA (Source: r/Games post from May 2022). 2K Games reportedly secured the FIFA license. No competing FIFA-branded game had been released as of the research period.

### EA Acquisition (2025)
- EA was acquired for $55 billion by PIF (Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners (Source: r/EASportsFC post 1ntgp6o, June 2025)

### Historical FIFA Franchise Sales Context
- The FIFA/FC franchise has historically been one of the best-selling annual game franchises globally
- FIFA is explicitly acknowledged as Europe's fastest-selling game franchise (per GamesIndustry.biz data referenced in r/Games)
- FIFA 23 was the last FIFA-branded title; FC 24 was the first under new EA Sports FC branding
- EA reportedly saved ~$150M/year by dropping the FIFA license
- The franchise derives a significant portion of its revenue from FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) microtransactions, not just copy sales
- Reddit users consistently note that EA does not regularly disclose specific unit sales for FC/FIFA titles, preferring to use "players" or "net bookings" metrics

### Key Limitation
EA does not publicly disclose specific copy sales numbers for the EA Sports FC franchise. They report:
- "Players" (which includes EA Play trial users, not just purchasers)
- "Net bookings" (which includes copy sales + microtransactions combined)
- Revenue figures (in quarterly earnings)

No Reddit post found contained a definitive "EA Sports FC 24 sold X million copies" or "EA Sports FC 25 sold X million copies" figure.

## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

### Games Identified in Research Period (2023-2025):
1. **EA Sports FC 24** - Released September 29, 2023 (first game under new EA Sports FC branding)
2. **EA Sports FC 25** - Released September 27, 2024
3. **EA Sports FC 26** - Released September 2025 (at the boundary of the research period)

### Copy Sales Data Quality Assessment:

**EA Sports FC 24:**
- No definitive copy sales figure found on Reddit
- Best available data: **14.5 million players in first month** (includes non-purchasers via EA Play)
- Commercially successful; transition from FIFA branding was smooth
- EA saved ~$150M/year on licensing by dropping the FIFA name
- FUT/live services revenue of ~$5.4 billion in FY2024 shows the franchise's financial dominance

**EA Sports FC 25:**
- No definitive copy sales figure found on Reddit
- **Broke US launch revenue record for soccer games** (Circana data, September 2024 launch month)
- Then **significantly underperformed** EA's expectations over the full year
- EA slashed fiscal year forecast; stock dropped $6 billion
- Still was **#1 best-selling game in Europe H1 2025** across all 17 tracked countries
- **Worst user-rated game in franchise history** on Metacritic, Google, Steam
- EA Q3 FY2025 revenue fell from $1.94B to $1.88B partly due to FC weakness

**EA Sports FC 26 (for context):**
- European launch sales beaten by Battlefield 6
- UK physical sales beaten by Ghost of Yotei in FC 26's second week
- Aggressive discounting (50% off within 3 months)
- Continuing decline trend from FC 25

### Key Insight:
EA deliberately does not disclose unit sales for the FC/FIFA franchise. They use "players" and "net bookings" metrics instead. Reddit discussions consistently reflect this opacity -- no community member was able to cite a specific copies-sold figure from an official source. The best available data comes from:
1. EA earnings call reports (revenue figures, not unit sales)
2. Third-party tracking (Circana/NPD for US, GSD for Europe) -- reported as revenue, not units
3. EA press releases citing "players" not "buyers"
4. Comparative data (e.g., FC 26 outsold by BF6 in Europe, FC 25 was #1 in Europe H1 2025)

The FIFA/FC franchise remains an enormous commercial enterprise even in a "down" period. EA's total live services revenue ($5.4B in FY2024) dwarfs many game companies' total revenue, and FUT remains the single largest revenue driver for the company. However, the trend from FC 24 through FC 25 to FC 26 shows a clear decline in both commercial performance and community reception.
