## DETAILED POST ANALYSIS (with comments)

- **Comments:** 857
- **URL:** https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-lost-6-billion-in-market-value-following-fc-25-dragon-age-underperformance-news/
- **Date:** January 24, 2025

**Key comment insights:**
- u/Forestl (score 471): "Most of this is because of FC doing badly. They've made a shit ton of money from that game and it has helped them through other flops. To see those numbers going down is very bad"
- u/FlukyS (score 191): "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual..."
- u/orze (score 162): "Surprise the FIFA game is doing badly, don't know if it's the name change or FINALLY people got tired of it?"
- u/Klugenshmirtz (score 77): "I love how this sub talks only about Dragon Age when the real news is that the game formerly known as FIFA is not the exponential growing golden goose EA and its investors hoped it would be forever."
- u/SuperSpikeVBall (score 58): Hypothesizes that European economic downturn is driving FC revenue decline, noting FUT packs fall into discretionary spending category
- u/skpom (score 66): "EA stock is plunging. I don't think we'll see another dragon age game anytime soon if ever. Why did fc 25 do so poorly compared to 24?"

### Post 2: "Jason Schreier: EA is slashing its forecast for the fiscal year due to the underperformance of holiday games EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard."
- **Subreddit:** r/pcgaming
- **Post ID:** 1i7m0ck
- **Score:** 1004
- **Comments:** 311
- **URL:** Jason Schreier Bluesky post
- **Date:** January 22, 2025

**Key data from title:** EA slashed fiscal year forecast due to FC 25 underperformance. Dragon Age reached ~1.5 million players (missing expectations by nearly 50%).

**Key comment insights:**
- u/vKEVUv (score 251): "EA always had big internal expectations so a fact they only forecasted 3 million 'players' during initial sales window for AAA Dragon Age RPG... Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription"
- General consensus in comments: FC 25 underperformance was the bigger story than Dragon Age

### Post 3: "14.5m people played EA Sports FC its first month"
- **Subreddit:** r/gamernews
- **Post ID:** 17mq3a1
- **Score:** 118
- **Comments:** 27
- **URL:** https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/74111/145m-people-played-ea-sports-fc-its-first-month/
- **Date:** November 3, 2023

**KEY DATA POINT:** 14.5 million people played EA Sports FC 24 in its first month after launch (September/October 2023). Note: "players" includes EA Play trial users, not just purchasers.

**Key comment insights:**
- u/133DK (score 123): "FIFA really fucked themselves with their greed here. If there's one thing EA is good at, it's making these annual release macro transaction games that everyone and their dog plays"
- u/Gaudious (score 76): "So give or take EA mathematically made more this year than with FIFA last year. Because they're paying less licensing deals, making those deals with the clubs, leagues and players directly"
- u/Toiletpapermani (score 1): "Roughly speaking, EA has made more money this year than it did with FIFA last year. This is because they are reducing the amount they spend on licensing deals..."
- u/Yaadman876 (score 1): "They just be counting the 10 hour free trial that comes with EA access"

### Post 4: "EA Sports FC 25 launch breaks revenue record for soccer games | US Monthly Charts"

- **Score:** 0 (downvoted)

- **URL:** https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-sports-fc-25-launch-breaks-revenue-record-for-soccer-games-us-monthly-charts
- **Date:** October 24, 2024

**KEY DATA POINT:** EA Sports FC 25 launch broke revenue record for soccer games according to US Monthly Charts (Circana data). This was specifically about US launch month revenue. Note: "revenue record" could include premium edition pricing, not just unit sales.

### Post 5: "Electronic Arts saw revenue fall to $1.88 billion in its third quarter"
- **Subreddit:** r/Games
- **Post ID:** 1ihva33
- **Score:** 258
- **Comments:** 138
- **URL:** https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/electronics-arts-revenue-football-game-weakness-1236127266/
- **Date:** February 4, 2025

**KEY DATA POINT:** EA Q3 FY2025 revenue fell to $1.88B (from $1.94B year-earlier), partly due to weakness in EA Sports FC and Dragon Age franchises.

**Key comment insights:**
- u/Xenobrina (score 373): "Honestly really glad to see EA Sports FC in the headline unlike every other article that tries to pin it solely on Veilguard. EA sports losing money is a much more notable story anyway."
- u/scorchedneurotic (score 166): "Only $1.88 billion? Going belly up any day now for sure." (sarcastic)
- u/BatPixi (score 37): "Considering they are saving money on the fifa license this revenue could actually be positive for them."
- u/ItsStaaaaaaaaang (score 1): "Revenue might be down but what about actual profits? Surely not dumping truckloads of money at Fifa HQ would go a decent way to offset the drop in revenue?"

### Post 6: "EAFC 26's release saw a significant drop in both peak and average viewers on twitch compared to previous titles."
- **Subreddit:** r/EASportsFC
- **Post ID:** 1nwvfd1
- **Score:** 238
- **Comments:** 90
- **Date:** October 2025 (post-FC 26 launch)

Shows declining viewership trend from FC 24 -> FC 25 -> FC 26 on Twitch. Comments note Twitch is declining overall, but the relative drop is still notable.

### Post 7: "FC 25 and Assassin's Creed Shadows top the best selling games list in Europe for first half of 2025"
- **Subreddit:** r/Games
- **Post ID:** 1m2vrvv
- **Score:** 187
- **Comments:** 148
- **URL:** https://www.vgchartz.com/article/465238/europe-h1-2025/
- **Date:** July 2025

**KEY DATA POINT:** EA Sports FC 25 was the #1 best-selling game in Europe for the first half of 2025.

**Key comment insights:**
- u/SilveryDeath (score 59): Provided detailed breakdown - FC 25 topped all 17 tracked European countries. Listed top-selling games: 1) EA Sports FC 25, 2) Assassin's Creed Shadows, 3) Minecraft
- u/StunLT (score 111): "Is that really surprising? Football will always be popular and the core gameplay works and it's fun to play. Sports games will always have their fan base plus there's always new young people who want to play those games."

### Post 8: "Battlefield 6 sold more copies across Europe at launch than Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. It even beat launch sales of EA Sports FC 26"
- **Subreddit:** r/gaming
- **Post ID:** 1o9atzm
- **Score:** 895
- **Comments:** 60
- **URL:** https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/battlefield-6-launch-sales-bigger
- **Date:** October 2025

**KEY DATA POINT:** EA Sports FC 26 launch sales in Europe were beaten by Battlefield 6 (and BF6 also beat COD: Black Ops 6). This indicates FC 26 had weaker European launch sales than a shooter game.

**Key comment insights:**
- u/SamShakusky71 (score 247): Quoted article caveat: "Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was included in Xbox Game Pass, which means it's likely Call of Duty had a far higher player count than Battlefield 6. This GSD data is purely premium sales."

### Post 9: "'Really, Really Good': Ghost of Yotei Beats EA Sports FC 26, Super Mario Galaxy in UK Physical Sales"

- **Date:** October 2025

**KEY DATA POINT:** FC 26 was outsold in UK physical sales by Ghost of Yotei at launch.

**Key comment insights:**
- u/pogray (score 813): "Beating Fifa on sales in the UK is some feat"
- u/DodgerCyclops (score 285): "This is pointless, physical sales are tiny now so using this as any sort of metric is a waste there's no point counting it" (links to BBC article: "Almost 90% of games sold in UK in 2022 were digital")
- u/baddude1337 (score 27): "Physical only, be more interested to see total sales. Still, even for physical beating EAFC is quite impressive. I expect a lot of the casual sports only gamers still buy physical."

### Post 10: "FC 25 Is the Worst User-Rated Game in Franchise History Across Several Major Review Sites"

- **Score:** 624
- **Comments:** 204
- **Date:** September 2025

Shows FC 25 received the worst user ratings in franchise history across Metacritic, Google Audience Rating, and Steam. This poor reception is context for its sales performance.

**Key comment insights:**
- u/PhriendlyPhantom (score 120): "They won't care because they still made a shit tonne of money"
- u/Primary-State-5929 (score 7): "I think the numbers EA get from the game are too high compared to the quality of their product. Microtransactions still give them billions every year."

### Post 11: "PS5, EA Sports FC 26 and Hogwarts Legacy come out top during Europe's Black Friday"
- **Subreddit:** r/Games
- **Post ID:** 1pfo1ph
- **Score:** 218
- **Comments:** 118
- **Date:** December 2025

**KEY DATA POINT:** FC 26 was one of the top-selling games during Europe's Black Friday 2025.

**Key comment insights:**
- u/srjnp (score 8): "fc26 was 50% off already less than 3 months from release" - suggests aggressive discounting to move units

### Post 12: "Fortnite playtime on consoles was greater than Call of Duty, EA Sports FC, GTA 5 and Roblox combined last month"
- **Subreddit:** r/gaming
- **Post ID:** 197cami
- **Score:** 4864
- **Comments:** 484
- **Date:** January 15, 2024

Contextual data showing EA Sports FC's (FC 24) playtime relative to other major franchises. FC 24 was still one of the top played games on consoles.

**Key comment insights:**
- u/[deleted] (score 237): "CoD and FIFA are both franchises that are hemorrhaging players. This doesn't seem that shocking to me."

## PER-GAME SUMMARY

### EA Sports FC 24 (Released: September 29, 2023)

**Copies Sold / Player Count Data Found on Reddit:**
- **14.5 million players in first month** (Source: r/gamernews post linking to pcgamesinsider.biz article from November 2023). Note: This is "players" not "copies sold" -- includes EA Play subscribers who had trial access.
- EA reported FC 24 had a successful launch, making more money than FIFA 23 despite dropping the FIFA name, partly because EA saved on the FIFA licensing fee (~$150M/year reportedly).
- No specific unit sales number (e.g., "X million copies sold") was found on Reddit for FC 24.
- FC 24 was considered commercially successful by EA and the transition from FIFA branding was viewed as smooth from a business perspective.

**Context from Reddit discussions:**
- The rebrand from FIFA to EA Sports FC was seen as a non-issue for sales (users on r/gamernews noted EA was making more money without the FIFA license fee)
- Competitive landscape: Fortnite had more playtime than FC, CoD, GTA V, and Roblox combined on consoles (January 2024 data)
- EA pulled old FIFA games from digital storefronts (Steam etc.) as FC 24 launched

**Estimated copies sold (inferred from Reddit data):** No direct copy sales figure found. The 14.5M player figure in the first month would include some EA Play trial users. Historical FIFA franchise context suggests annual sales in the range of 10-15 million copies per title, with FC 24 reportedly performing in line with or slightly above FIFA 23.

---

### EA Sports FC 25 (Released: September 27, 2024)

**Copies Sold / Revenue Data Found on Reddit:**
- **Broke US launch revenue record for soccer games** (Source: r/gamernews post linking to gamesindustry.biz Circana data from October 2024). Note: "Revenue record" likely includes premium/ultimate edition pricing ($100+ editions), not necessarily unit sales record.
- **Underperformed EA's internal expectations** (Source: Multiple Reddit posts from January 2025 citing Jason Schreier, VGC, Hollywood Reporter). EA slashed its fiscal year forecast due to FC 25 underperformance.
- **EA lost $6 billion in market value** partly due to FC 25 underperformance (Source: r/Games post from January 2025 linking to VGC)
- **EA Q3 FY2025 revenue fell from $1.94B to $1.88B** partly due to FC weakness (Source: r/Games post from February 2025 linking to Hollywood Reporter)
- **#1 best-selling game in Europe, H1 2025** across all 17 tracked countries (Source: r/Games post from July 2025 linking to VGChartz)
- **Worst user-rated game in franchise history** across Metacritic, Google, and Steam (Source: r/EASportsFC post from September 2025)
- No specific unit sales number (e.g., "X million copies sold") was found on Reddit for FC 25.

**Context from Reddit discussions:**
- FC 25 initially broke launch revenue records in the US but then saw significant decline in ongoing sales/engagement
- EA's net bookings (which includes both copy sales and microtransactions) fell short of expectations
- The "revenue record" at launch likely driven by premium edition pricing strategy, but sustained sales and microtransaction revenue dropped
- Despite being commercially disappointing by EA's standards, FC 25 was still Europe's #1 best-selling game in H1 2025 -- showing the franchise's enormous baseline even in a "down" year
- Reddit community consensus: FC 25 was poorly received but still made significant money due to franchise momentum

**Estimated copies sold (inferred from Reddit data):** No direct copy sales figure found. The game underperformed EA's expectations but was still the best-selling game in Europe for H1 2025. The drop in EA's overall revenue and slashed forecast suggests FC 25 sold fewer copies and/or generated less microtransaction revenue than FC 24. Industry estimates from Reddit discussions suggest the total was likely below the 14.5M players mark that FC 24 achieved in its first month.

### EA Sports FC 26 (Released: September 2025) -- Note: Outside the 2023-2025 research window for releases, but data found

**Data Found on Reddit (for context):**
- FC 26 launch was outsold by Battlefield 6 in Europe (Source: r/gaming, October 2025)
- FC 26 was beaten by Ghost of Yotei in UK physical sales at launch (Source: r/gaming, October 2025)
- FC 26 was already 50% off less than 3 months from release at Black Friday 2025 (Source: r/Games, December 2025)
- FC 26 Twitch viewership saw significant drop vs. FC 25 and FC 24 (Source: r/EASportsFC, October 2025)
- Still a top seller during Black Friday in Europe alongside PS5 and Hogwarts Legacy

---

### Other Titles in Period

**FIFA-branded games (2023-2025):** No new FIFA-branded games were released. EA's last FIFA-branded game was FIFA 23 (released September 2022). From 2023 onward, the franchise was rebranded to EA Sports FC.

**EA Sports FC Mobile / FIFA Mobile:** Not specifically tracked in Reddit discussions found. The mobile versions operate as live-service titles with continuous updates rather than annual releases with discrete copy sales figures.

---

## ADDITIONAL CONTEXTUAL DATA FROM REDDIT

### EA Acquisition (2025)
- EA was acquired for $55 billion by PIF (Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners (Source: r/EASportsFC post from June 2025)

### Historical FIFA Franchise Sales Context
- The FIFA/FC franchise has historically been one of the best-selling annual game franchises globally
- FIFA 23 was the last FIFA-branded title; FC 24 was the first under the new EA Sports FC branding
- EA reportedly saved ~$150M/year by dropping the FIFA license
- The franchise derives a significant portion of its revenue from FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) microtransactions, not just copy sales
- Reddit users consistently note that EA does not regularly disclose specific unit sales for FC/FIFA titles, preferring to use "players" or "net bookings" metrics

### Key Limitation
EA does not publicly disclose specific copy sales numbers for the EA Sports FC franchise. They report:
- "Players" (which includes EA Play trial users, not just purchasers)
- "Net bookings" (which includes copy sales + microtransactions combined)
- Revenue figures (in quarterly earnings)

No Reddit post found contained a definitive "EA Sports FC 24 sold X million copies" or "EA Sports FC 25 sold X million copies" figure. The closest data points are:
- FC 24: 14.5 million players in first month (not copies sold)
- FC 25: Broke US launch revenue record for soccer games; was #1 in Europe H1 2025; but underperformed EA's internal expectations leading to forecast cuts and $6B market cap loss
- FC 26: Showed further decline indicators (outsold by BF6 in Europe, aggressive discounting)

## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

### Games Identified in Research Period (2023-2025):
1. **EA Sports FC 24** - Released September 29, 2023 (first game under new branding)
2. **EA Sports FC 25** - Released September 27, 2024

### Copy Sales Data Quality Assessment:
- **EA Sports FC 24:** No definitive copy sales figure found on Reddit. Best available data: 14.5 million players in first month (includes non-purchasers via EA Play). Commercial success confirmed.
- **EA Sports FC 25:** No definitive copy sales figure found on Reddit. Broke US launch revenue record but underperformed overall expectations. Was still #1 in Europe H1 2025. EA's market value dropped $6B and they slashed fiscal year forecasts partly due to FC 25.

### Key Insight:
EA deliberately does not disclose unit sales for the FC/FIFA franchise. They use "players" and "net bookings" metrics instead. Reddit discussions reflect this opacity -- no community member was able to cite a specific copies-sold figure from an official source. The best available data comes from:
1. EA earnings call reports (revenue, not units)
2. Third-party tracking (Circana/NPD for US, GSD/VGChartz for Europe)
3. EA press releases citing "players" not "buyers"
