# SECTION 3: PER-GAME SALES SUMMARY

---

## GAME 1: EA Sports FC 24 (Released September 29, 2023)

### Release Information
- First game under the "EA Sports FC" brand after dropping the FIFA name
- Platforms: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch
- Priced at $69.99 / GBP69.99 at launch

### Copy Sales Data Found on Reddit

**Direct data points:**
1. **11 million "players" in first week** -- from r/Games post (173ttky), commenter citing VGC article: "11 million is one week" -- NOTE: EA used "players" not "copies sold" which includes EA Play trial users
2. **EA claimed FC 24 attracted more players at launch than FIFA 23** -- VGC article posted to r/Games (Oct 2023)
3. **No specific lifetime copy sales figure found on Reddit** -- EA does not publicly disclose per-title unit sales for its sports games

**Indirect indicators:**
- FC 24 was EA's first non-FIFA branded title; the successful launch (~11M players week 1) validated the rebrand
- EA reported strong FY2024 results, with FC 24 meeting expectations
- Commenters noted FC 24 had crossplay for the first time, boosting player counts
- One commenter: "I had bought every fifa game since 1998, but didn't buy EA FC 24 and 25" -- anecdotal evidence of some long-term buyers dropping off

**Estimated copy sales based on Reddit discussion context:**
- No exact figure was stated on Reddit
- Based on the 11 million "player" count in week 1 (which includes EA Play trials), actual PAID copy sales in week 1 were likely lower -- probably in the 6-8 million range based on historical FIFA sales patterns discussed in various threads
- FIFA 23 sold approximately 10-11 million copies in its first week per historical data discussed on Reddit; EA claimed FC 24 matched or exceeded this
- Lifetime sales: Reddit discussions do not provide a specific number, but the franchise historically sells 10-15 million copies per annual release

6. **FC 25 was the worst user-rated game in franchise history** across Metacritic, Google, and Steam (r/EASportsFC post 1n7ixhg)
7. **FC 25 added to Xbox Game Pass June 2025** -- very early vault addition (r/Games post 1l3yklu)

**No specific unit sales figure found on Reddit** -- EA never disclosed FC 25 copy sales numbers. They only referenced it as "underperforming" relative to internal expectations.

**Indirect indicators:**
- The $6 billion market cap loss was primarily driven by FC revenue concerns, not Dragon Age
- EA's Q3 revenue decline ($1.88B vs $1.94B) was partially attributable to FC 25
- Free Showcase version release in December 2024 suggests EA was struggling to convert players to paid copies
- Worst user ratings in franchise history likely depressed word-of-mouth sales
- Multiple Reddit users reported quitting the franchise or not buying FC 25

**Estimated copy sales based on Reddit discussion context:**
- No exact figure stated on Reddit
- Given that EA slashed forecasts and the game underperformed, FC 25 likely sold SIGNIFICANTLY fewer copies than FC 24
- Reddit consensus suggests 20-30% decline from FC 24 levels
- One key thread notes European economic conditions affecting discretionary gaming spend

- Released late September / early October 2025

### Copy Sales Data Found on Reddit

**Direct data points:**
1. **Ghost of Yotei beat FC 26 in UK physical sales at launch** -- Push Square, Oct 2025, posted to r/gaming (1nzc677). Key caveat: physical sales are now ~10% of total in UK; digital is dominant.
2. **Battlefield 6 beat FC 26 in European launch sales** -- The Game Business, Oct 2025, posted to r/gaming (1o9atzm). This is GSD data = premium (paid) copy sales only.
3. **FC 26 was a top seller during Europe's Black Friday 2025** -- The Game Business, Dec 2025, posted to r/Games (1pfo1ph). Shows recovery in holiday sales.
4. **FC 26 received very negative community reception** -- r/EASportsFC post 1p9xn9n: "FC 26 is the worst football game of all Fifa series"
5. **PC input delay mega-thread** had 729 upvotes and 347 comments (r/EASportsFC post 1npg5mw) -- suggests significant technical issues at launch

**No specific unit sales figure found on Reddit** -- FC 26 is too recent (released ~4 months before today's date) for comprehensive sales data to be discussed.

**Indirect indicators:**
- Being beaten by Battlefield 6 in European launch sales is a negative signal -- historically FIFA/FC was the biggest premium launch in Europe annually
- However, FC 26 recovered to become a top Black Friday seller
- The $55B EA acquisition deal suggests investors valued the FC/FUT franchise highly despite recent declines
- Community complaints about FC 26 quality mirror FC 25 complaints, but FC 26 marketing emphasized "listening to community"

**Estimated copy sales based on Reddit discussion context:**
- No exact figure stated on Reddit
- FC 26 is too recent for comprehensive sales data
- Launch sales appear weaker than historical FIFA norms based on European chart data
- Holiday/Black Friday recovery likely boosted overall numbers
- Being beaten at launch by Battlefield 6 and Ghost of Yotei (in physical) suggests a possible continued decline from FC 25 levels

# SECTION 4: FRANCHISE-LEVEL CONTEXT AND ADDITIONAL DATA

## EA Rebrand Timeline (found on Reddit)
- **May 2022:** EA announces FIFA will be rebranded to "EA Sports FC" starting summer 2023 (r/EASportsFC post umlupi, score: 1450)
- **May 2022:** FIFA organization confirms it will create its own rival game and claims it will be "the only authentic, real game" (r/Games post umrmmi, score: 2841)
- **2021:** EA revealed FIFA organization was demanding $1 billion for naming rights (r/Games post q7tnmc, score: 4921)
- **September 2023:** EA delists all old FIFA titles from Steam as FC 24 launches (r/gaming post 16to3kb, score: 6160)

## EA's Reluctance to Share Sales Numbers
- **2022:** EA refused to give Battlefield 2042 sale numbers to investors, stating "Battlefield is less than 10% of our portfolio" (r/pcgaming post si7vsx, score: 4542)
- EA consistently uses "players" instead of "copies sold" in their announcements -- this inflates numbers by including EA Play trial users, Game Pass users, and free trial downloads
- The franchise's exact copy sales are deliberately obscured by EA

## FIFA/EA FC Historical UK Chart Dominance
- **2022:** "Elden Ring is the biggest non-FIFA or Call of Duty launch since Red Dead Redemption 2" (r/Games post t5txhx, score: 13915) -- demonstrates that FIFA historically dominates UK launches year after year
- The fact that FC 26 was beaten by Ghost of Yotei and Battlefield 6 represents a significant departure from this historical dominance

## EA Overall Financial Context
- **EA acquired for $55 billion** by PIF/Silver Lake/Affinity Partners in 2025
- Despite FC underperformance, the franchise remains EA's most valuable IP
- EA Sports College Football 25 sold 2.2M copies at $100 each with early access (r/gaming post 1ea24xk) -- shows EA's other sports titles performing well

## Player Sentiment Trends
- FC 25: Worst user-rated in franchise history (Metacritic, Google, Steam)
- FC 26: Also receiving very negative reception
- Multiple users report quitting the franchise entirely
- Community sentiment: "EA are just a money grabbing bunch of incompetent asses"
- Release of free FC 25 Showcase version interpreted as panic/desperation by community

# SECTION 5: SUMMARY OF COPY SALES DATA AVAILABILITY

| Game | Release Year | Specific Copy Sales Figure Found? | Best Data Available |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| EA Sports FC 24 | 2023 | NO | 11M "players" week 1 (includes non-purchasers); EA claimed it matched/exceeded FIFA 23 |
| EA Sports FC 25 | 2024 | NO | Confirmed "underperforming" by EA; caused $6B market cap loss; Q3 revenue fell $1.88B vs $1.94B YoY |
| EA Sports FC 26 | 2025 | NO | Lost UK physical and European launch charts to competitors; recovered for Black Friday |

**Critical finding:** EA does NOT publicly disclose per-title unit sales for EA Sports FC games. They exclusively use "player count" language which inflates figures by including:
- EA Play / EA Play Pro trial users
- Game Pass subscribers (especially for FC 25 which hit Game Pass June 2025)
- PS Plus free trial users
- Free Showcase version downloads (FC 25)

Reddit discussions consistently flag this as a misleading metric. No Reddit source had an authoritative, exact copy-sales-only figure for any of the three FC titles.
