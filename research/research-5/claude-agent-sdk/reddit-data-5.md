# SECTION 3: PER-GAME SALES SUMMARY

---

## GAME 1: EA Sports FC 24

### Release Information
- **Release Date**: September 29, 2023
- **Platforms**: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch
- **Cover Star**: Erling Haaland
- **Price**: $69.99 / 69.99 GBP
- **Significance**: First game under the EA Sports FC brand after dropping the FIFA license

### Copy Sales Data Found on Reddit

**NO EXACT UNIT SALES FIGURE WAS FOUND ON REDDIT.**

EA does not publicly disclose per-title unit sales for its sports games. They use "players" language which includes EA Play trial users, not just purchasers.

**Best available proxy data from Reddit**:

1. **Steam Player Count vs FIFA 23** (Dec 2023): FC 24 Steam concurrent players were approximately 30% lower than FIFA 23 at the same lifecycle point.
   - Source: r/EASportsFC post 18toyd1 (score: 581)
   - CAVEAT: FIFA 23 had a World Cup boost; Steam does not capture EA App or Epic Store players
   - Community pushback: "Those steam charts don't count all of the PC players on epic or directly from EA app" (score: 164)

2. **PlayStation Plus Inclusion** (May 2024): FC 24 was added to PlayStation Plus just ~8 months after launch.
   - Source: r/PS5 post 1chp0eh (score: 1550)

3. **EA Revenue Context**: EA's Q3 FY25 earnings (~$2 billion quarterly revenue) included FC franchise contribution. Post on r/EASportsFC referenced "almost 2 billion in revenue."

4. **Historical Franchise Context**: The FIFA/FC franchise typically sells 10-15+ million copies per annual release based on historical patterns discussed across Reddit.

### Sales Assessment from Reddit Data
- FC 24 appears to have performed ADEQUATELY at launch given the rebrand
- Steam data showed a decline vs FIFA 23, but this was partially explained by World Cup boost for FIFA 23 and platform shift
- EA was not reported as being dissatisfied with FC 24 sales (unlike FC 25)
- Added to PS Plus at ~8 months (typical lifecycle progression)

- **Price**: $69.99 / 69.99 GBP
- **Significance**: Widely considered worst entry in franchise history by community

### Copy Sales Data Found on Reddit

**NO EXACT UNIT SALES FIGURE WAS FOUND ON REDDIT.**

However, Reddit contains the most extensive evidence of significant UNDERPERFORMANCE:

1. **UK Launch Sales "Slightly Lower" Than FC 24** (Oct 2024):
   - Christopher Dring: "EA Sports FC25 launch sales are slightly lower than FC24, but premium edition sales are up"
   - Source: r/Games post 1fy73h6 (score: 150)

2. **FC 25 Was Half Price by Mid-November 2024** (7 weeks after launch):
   - Source: r/PS5 comment (score: 358): "FC25 released September 27th and was half price mid-November, it wasn't hard to wait."

3. **EA Slashed Fiscal Year Forecast** (Jan 2025):
   - Jason Schreier: "EA is slashing its forecast for the fiscal year due to the underperformance of holiday games EA Sports FC 25..."
   - Source: r/pcgaming post 1i7m0ck (score: 1002), r/PS5 post 1i7m1am (score: 1502)

4. **EA Lost $6 Billion in Market Value** (Jan 2025):
   - Primarily driven by FC underperformance, not Dragon Age
   - Source: r/Games post 1i8x6am (score: 1955)
   - Key comment (score 470): "Most of this is because of FC doing badly"

5. **EA Q3 FY25 Revenue Declined** (Feb 2025):
   - Revenue fell to $1.88B from $1.94B YoY; weakness attributed to FC and Dragon Age
   - Source: r/Games post 1ihva33 (score: 256)

6. **Monthly Active Users Declined vs FC 24** (Jan 2025):
   - Graph showed FC 25 MAU consistently below FC 24 at every point
   - Source: r/EASportsFC post 1i985e1 (score: 116)

7. **Steam Data**: FC 25 peak was 110,026 concurrent players (Sept 29, 2024); dropped to ~34,672 by mid-November 2024
   - Source: r/maths post 1gre101

8. **Worst User Ratings in Franchise History** across Metacritic, Google, Steam:
   - Source: r/EASportsFC post 1n7ixhg (score: 622)

### Sales Assessment from Reddit Data
- FC 25 is confirmed as a significant underperformer by EA's own statements (forecast slash, $6B market cap loss)
- UK physical launch sales were "slightly lower" than FC 24 -- but the full picture was much worse over time
- Aggressive 50% discounting just 7 weeks after launch indicates very poor sell-through
- Community interpreted free Showcase version (Dec 2024) as a desperation move
- FC 25 was the BIGGEST factor in EA's $6 billion market cap loss -- bigger than Dragon Age: The Veilguard

## GAME 3: EA Sports FC 26

### Release Information
- **Release Date**: September 18, 2025
- **Platforms**: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC (likely dropped last-gen and Switch)
- **Reveal Date**: July 16, 2025 (official trailer)
- **Price**: 69.99 GBP digital (from Reddit comment)
- **Significance**: Third FC-branded game; released around EA's $55B acquisition by PIF/Silver Lake

### Copy Sales Data Found on Reddit

**NO EXACT UNIT SALES FIGURE WAS FOUND ON REDDIT.**

FC 26 was released approximately 5 months before this research date. Available data:

1. **UK Physical Sales -- Beaten by Ghost of Yotei in Week 2** (Oct 2025):
   - Ghost of Yotei was No. 1 in UK boxed sales, beating the second week of FC 26
   - Source: r/PS5 post 1nyu1z1 (score: 663), r/gaming post 1nzc677 (score: 1244)
   - CAVEAT: Physical sales represent only ~10-15% of total UK game sales

2. **European Launch Sales -- Beaten by Battlefield 6** (Oct 2025):
   - BF6 outsold both FC 26 and CoD: Black Ops 6 in European premium copy launch sales
   - Source: r/gaming post 1o9atzm (score: 893)
   - This is GSD (Games Sales Data) = premium/paid copy sales only

3. **Black Friday 2025 -- Top Seller** (Dec 2025):
   - FC 26 was among Europe's top-selling games during Black Friday
   - Source: r/Games post 1pfo1ph (score: 221)

4. **Community Reception**: Mixed to negative
   - "FC 26 is the worst football game of all Fifa series" (score: 139, r/EASportsFC)
   - Major PC input delay complaints (megathread score: 727)
   - But also active competitive community (352 guide post score: 635)

### Sales Assessment from Reddit Data
- FC 26 launch appears weaker than historical FIFA norms (beaten by BF6 in Europe, by Ghost of Yotei in UK physical)
- However, strong Black Friday performance suggests decent holiday recovery
- Too early for comprehensive lifetime sales data
- The EA acquisition ($55B) suggests investors still valued the FC/FUT franchise highly despite recent declines
- No specific copy sales number was announced or discussed on Reddit

# SECTION 4: ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

## EA's Pattern of Not Disclosing Unit Sales
- EA consistently uses "players" instead of "copies sold" -- this inflates figures by including EA Play trials, Game Pass access, free versions, etc.
- Comment on r/pcgaming (score: 249): "Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription"
- This pattern was also noted for Battlefield 2042 where EA refused to share sale numbers

## FIFA/EA FC Franchise Revenue Model
- Copy sales (physical + digital) are only part of the revenue picture
- Ultimate Team (FUT) microtransactions represent a massive portion of EA Sports FC revenue
- Comment on r/EASportsFC (score: 375): "55 f---ing billion???? How much were they making from MTx, damn..."
- EA's "almost 2 billion" in Q3 FY25 revenue includes both copy sales and live service revenue
- The research request focuses specifically on COPY SALES, but EA bundles these with MTX in financial reporting

## Key Financial Timeline from Reddit
- **Q3 FY25 (Oct-Dec 2024)**: Revenue fell to $1.88B from $1.94B (r/Games)
- **Jan 2025**: EA slashed FY25 forecast; lost $6B market cap (r/Games, r/pcgaming, r/PS5)
- **Feb 2025**: Hollywood Reporter reported the revenue decline tied to FC and Dragon Age (r/Games)
- **Sept 2025**: EA acquired for $55B by PIF/Silver Lake/Affinity Partners (r/EASportsFC)

## Steam Concurrent Player Data (from Reddit sources)
| Title | Peak Concurrent (Steam) | Source |
|-------|------------------------|--------|
| FIFA 23 | Higher than FC 24 (exact not stated) | r/EASportsFC 18toyd1 |
| EA Sports FC 24 | ~30% lower than FIFA 23 | r/EASportsFC 18toyd1 |
| EA Sports FC 25 | 110,026 (Sept 29, 2024) | r/maths 1gre101 |
| EA Sports FC 26 | Not found on Reddit | N/A |

# SECTION 5: SUMMARY OF DATA AVAILABILITY

| Game | Release | Exact Copy Sales on Reddit? | Best Proxy Data |
|------|---------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| EA Sports FC 24 | Sept 2023 | NO | Steam ~30% below FIFA 23; EA said it matched/exceeded FIFA 23 at launch |
| EA Sports FC 25 | Sept 2024 | NO | UK launch "slightly lower" than FC 24; caused EA forecast slash and $6B market cap loss; worst user-rated ever |
| EA Sports FC 26 | Sept 2025 | NO | Beaten by BF6 in Europe and Ghost of Yotei in UK physical; strong Black Friday performer |

**CRITICAL FINDING**: EA does NOT publicly disclose per-title copy sales for EA Sports FC games. No Reddit post contained an authoritative, exact copies-sold figure for any of these three titles. All sales assessment is based on proxy data: chart positions, comparative performance, EA financial statements, Steam player counts, and community discussion of industry analyst reports.
