### Post 1: "EA lost $6 billion in market value, following FC 25 & Dragon Age underperformance news"

- **Permalink**: https://reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1i8x6am/

**Key Comments**:
- (score 1146) u/Cynical_onlooker: "Honestly, the thing that surprises me most about this news was how realistic EA's expectations were for the sales. 3 million should be more than obtainable for a high budget AAA fantasy RPG nowadays. I do wonder how much more of a leash they're going to give Bioware."
- (score 470) u/Forestl: "Most of this is because of FC doing badly. They've made a shit ton of money from that game and it has helped them through other flops. To see those numbers going down is very bad"
- (score 233) u/SuperSoftSucculent: "Have they tried making good games? I feel like that might help out."
- (score 193) u/FlukyS: "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual. Like the last 2 releases had the new anticheat that has been buggy as shit, they still are charging the full price even though they haven't added anything of value really in the last few releases and actually if anything they made stuff a bit worse on occasion."
- (score 157) u/orze: "Surprise the FIFA game is doing badly, don't know if it's the name change or FINALLY people got tired of it?"
- (score 76) u/Klugenshmirtz: "I love how this sub talks only about Dragon Age when the real news is that the game formerly known as FIFA is not the exponential growing golden goose EA and its investors hoped it would be forever."
- (score 70) u/skpom: "EA stock is plunging. I don't think we'll see another dragon age game anytime soon if ever. Why did fc 25 do so poorly compared to 24?"
- (score 58) u/SuperSpikeVBall: "This is a games subreddit, so of course people are going to focus on the playability and features of EA FC, but my hypothesis is that this is driven by economics. Europe's economy (especially UK/Germany) is in the toilet and FUT packs 100% fall into the discretionary spending category."
- (score 76) u/froggyjm9: "I had bought every fifa game since 1998, but didn't buy EA FC 24 and 25..."

**Relevance**: Confirms FC 25 significantly underperformed. $6 billion market cap loss driven primarily by FC 25 weakness. Multiple comments confirm the FC franchise is the bigger financial story vs Dragon Age.

- (score 562) u/probywan1337: "Veilguard has some of the worst writing I've ever witnessed in an RPG."
- (score 258) u/C_Werner: Discussion of Dragon Age underperformance and toxic positivity on the DA subreddit.
- (score 247) u/vKEVUv: **"EA always had big internal expectations so a fact they only forecasted 3 million 'players' during initial sales window for AAA Dragon Age RPG... Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription so while not significant % of people played using EA Play and GFNOW those still make up some chunk of 'players'"** -- THIS CONFIRMS THE PLAYERS VS COPIES SOLD DISTINCTION
- (score 192) u/AdNo266: "I feel like this isn't much of a surprise"

**Relevance**: EA slashed fiscal year forecast due to FC 25 underperformance. The comment by vKEVUv explicitly calls out the "players" vs "copies sold" distinction -- EA counts EA Play subscribers and GeForce Now users in its "player" metrics.

- (score 441) u/whyamihere2473527: "50% is bad but imo if expectations were only 3 million i feel like that is a low bar for a popular established franchise that was in development for almost a decade"
- (score 362) u/Santino_18: **"FC25 released September 27th and was half price mid-November, it wasn't hard to wait."** -- Confirms FC 25 was 50% off within about 7 weeks of launch.

**Key Comments**:
- (score 371) u/Xenobrina: "Honestly really glad to see EA Sports FC in the headline unlike every other article that tries to pin it solely on Veilguard. EA sports losing money is a much more notable story anyway."
- (score 170) u/scorchedneurotic: "Only $1.88 billion? Going belly up any day now for sure."

- (score 18) u/Villag3Idiot: "Are people finally tired of EA's annual sports game rehash or is there some other reason?"

**Relevance**: EA Q3 FY25 revenue fell from $1.94B to $1.88B year-over-year, with EA Sports FC and Dragon Age cited as contributing factors.

**Post Content Snippet**: "despite almost 2 billion in revenue that we, players, generate" (linking to https://www.ea.com/news/electronic-arts-reports-q3-fy25-results)

**Key Comments**:

**Relevance**: References "almost 2 billion in revenue" from EA Sports overall (linking to EA Q3 FY25 results). This is total revenue including microtransactions, not just copy sales. Confirms FC 26 was live by October 2025.

### Post 7: "'Really, Really Good': Ghost of Yotei Beats EA Sports FC 26, Super Mario Galaxy in UK Physical Sales"

**Key Comments**:
- (score 813) u/pogray: "Beating Fifa on sales in the UK is some feat"
- (score 288) u/DodgerCyclops: "This is pointless, physical sales are tiny now so using this as any sort of metric is a waste there's no point counting it. Almost 90% of games sold in UK in 2022 were digital - ERA"
- (score 51) u/TroonSpoon: "physical was also 10 GBP cheaper than digital, which was 69.99 GBP."
- (score 27) u/baddude1337: "Physical only, be more interested to see total sales. Still, even for physical beating EAFC is quite impressive. I expect a lot of the casual sports only gamers still buy physical."
- (score 26) u/BioDioPT: "Selling 40% less than GoT really makes me worry about the future of physical media..."

**Relevance**: Ghost of Yotei beat FC 26 in UK physical sales at launch. Being beaten by a PS exclusive in the UK (where FIFA/FC historically dominates physical charts) is notable. However, caveat that ~90% of UK sales are now digital.

### Post 8: "Battlefield 6 sold more copies across Europe at launch than Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. It even beat launch sales of EA Sports FC 26"

**Key Comments**:
- (score 244) u/SamShakusky71: "'There are a few caveats. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was included in Xbox Game Pass, which means it's likely Call of Duty had a far higher player count than Battlefield 6. This GSD data is purely premium sales.'"
- (score 50) u/NikaroTheSwift: "Great, now they should have a little money to invest in BIGGER MAPS"

**Relevance**: Battlefield 6 beat EA Sports FC 26 in European launch premium copy sales (GSD data). This is particularly notable because FC/FIFA has historically been the dominant game in European markets. The data is "purely premium sales" -- actual copies sold, not player counts.

- (score 77) u/Izzy248: "Every time I see Hogwarts Legacy still charting on these sales reports..."
- (score 69) u/Zhukov-74: "A 62% market share [for PS5 hardware] is really impressive given the fact that we are talking about a 5 year old console."
- (score 32) u/Boblawblahhs: "Hogwarts Legacy is a weird one. From the discourse online, you'd think it was the most mid game ever..."

**Relevance**: FC 26 was among top-sellers during European Black Friday 2025, but this was during a period of deep discounting.

- (score 70) u/Dubsified: "Soulless company selling its soul"

**Relevance**: EA (the entire company, not just the sports division) was acquired by PIF/Silver Lake/Affinity Partners for $55 billion. This happened during the FC 26 lifecycle. Title is misleading -- "EA Sports" specifically was not sold; the parent company Electronic Arts was acquired.

**Content snippet**: "If I played the game without touching D-pad, I'd think it is just 24. Same midfield congestion, same braindead attacking AI, same braindead CBs looking at the ball..."

**Relevance**: Pre-release community sentiment that FC 25 was minimal effort, nearly identical to FC 24. Foreshadowed the sales underperformance.

### Post 13: "EA has given up selling loot boxes in the FC 25,26 in South Korea"

**Content snippet**: "EA recently unveiled FC 26, but in South Korea, due to a law that mandates the disclosure of probabilities for loot boxes, they have restricted the purchase of FC Points. I just checked, and the purchase of FC Points in FC 25 has also been blocked."

**Relevance**: EA blocked FC Points (microtransaction currency) in both FC 25 and FC 26 in South Korea rather than comply with probability disclosure laws. Shows EA's reliance on opaque loot box mechanics for revenue.

### Post 14: "Circana September 2025: Borderlands 4 generated the highest launch month dollar sales of any title in franchise history"

- **Score**: 459 | **Comments**: 400
- **Date**: October 21, 2025
- **Permalink**: https://reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1od7v2m/

**Relevance**: Circana US data for September 2025 shows Borderlands 4 was the #1 best-seller. EA Sports FC 26 (which launched in the same window) was NOT mentioned as the best-selling title. This means FC 26 did not top its launch month in the US -- historically unusual for the franchise.

### Post 15: "Circana: Battlefield 6 debuted as the best-selling game of 2025 year-to-date"

**Key Comments**:
- (score 332) u/PhatYeeter: "Black Ops 6 being in the top 10 a month before Black Ops 7 comes out is wild."
- (score 186) u/Kaladin-of-Gilead: "It's a good game that's really popular [referring to BF6]..."
- (score 77) u/grailly: "I did not realize NBA games were that popular, Always thought Madden was bigger?"
- (score 52) u/MrBombastic21: "Maybe the title should include that this about the US?"

**Relevance**: BF6 was the best-selling game of 2025 YTD in the US as of October Circana data. FC 26 was NOT the top-selling game. NBA 2K26 was #1 on PlayStation. FC 26 not appearing prominently in US annual sales rankings is a departure from the franchise's historical performance.

**Relevance**: EA Sports FC 24 was given away free on PlayStation Plus in May 2024, approximately 7 months after its September 2023 launch. This inflated "player" counts significantly but represents zero additional copy sales.

**Content snippet**: "I want to sincerely thank EA for what FC25 has brought into my life. Not in terms of entertainment or gameplay. Those are long gone, but in something far more valuable."

**Relevance**: Satirical/ironic post highlighting deep community dissatisfaction with FC 25. 1332 upvotes with 97% upvote ratio. Reflects the widespread negative sentiment that contributed to sales decline.

- **ID**: si7vsx
- **Subreddit**: r/pcgaming
- **Score**: 4545
- **Date**: February 1, 2022

**Relevance**: Demonstrates EA's long-standing practice of NOT disclosing specific unit sales numbers. EA said "Battlefield is less than 10% of our portfolio so not sure what you'll do with those numbers." This pattern explains why no specific copy sales figures exist on Reddit for FC titles either.

- (score 320) u/Milliennium_Falcon: "This is US sales chart ranked by dollar sales, not global chart, nor ranked by units sold."

**Relevance**: FC 25 was NOT in the US top 20 best-selling games for February 2025, about 5 months after its launch. This confirms the game's rapid fade from sales charts.

## Per-Game Summary: Titles and Copies Sold Data

---

### EA Sports FC 24 (Released: September 29, 2023)

**Copies Sold Data Found on Reddit**:
- **No specific copy sales figure was found on Reddit for EA Sports FC 24.** EA does not typically report unit sales for individual titles; they report "players" which includes EA Play subscribers, trial users, and PS Plus giveaway recipients.
- FC 24 was given away free on PlayStation Plus in May 2024 (~7 months post-launch), which inflated player counts but added zero copy sales.
- FC 24 was discounted 50% by November 2023 (~6 weeks after launch).
- FC 24 appeared to perform in line with franchise expectations at launch. No underperformance reports were found for FC 24 specifically. Multiple later posts contrast FC 25's poor performance against FC 24, implying FC 24 was considered "normal."
- The FIFA/FC franchise historically sells in the range of 6-15 million copies per annual title. EA never publicly disclosed exact FC 24 copy sales.
- EA raised stock profit projections in November 2023 (per r/EASportsFC post 17umubg comment by u/Jaytee_Thomas), suggesting FC 24 met or exceeded initial expectations.

**Revenue Context**:
- EA Q3 FY25 results referenced "almost 2 billion in revenue" for EA Sports overall (post 1olq87u), but this includes ALL revenue streams (copies + FUT microtransactions + live service).

**Key Reddit Sources**:
- Post 16to3kb: EA pulled old FIFA games from storefronts as FC 24 launched
- Post 1chp0eh: FC 24 given away on PS Plus May 2024

  - EA lost $6 billion in market value specifically due to FC 25 and Dragon Age underperformance (post 1i8x6am, score 1957)
  - EA slashed its fiscal year forecast citing FC 25 weakness (post 1i7m0ck, score 1006)
  - EA Q3 FY25 revenue fell to $1.88B vs $1.94B prior year, with FC cited (post 1ihva33, score 261)

- Community characterized FC 25 as "the least effort EA has ever put in" even before launch (post 1em3old, score 515)
- The "players" vs "copies sold" distinction was explicitly called out by Reddit user vKEVUv (score 247): "Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription"

**Key Reddit Sources**:

## Critical Context Notes

### EA Does Not Disclose Unit Sales for FC/FIFA Titles
A recurring finding across all searches: EA does not publicly disclose specific copy/unit sales figures for its FIFA/FC games. The company reports "players" (inflated by subscription access, free trials, PS Plus giveaways) and revenue/net bookings in aggregate. This was corroborated by:
- EA's refusal to share Battlefield 2042 numbers (post si7vsx)
- Reddit user vKEVUv's comment about "players" including EA Play and GeForce Now users
- The absence of any Reddit post citing a specific "X million copies sold" figure for any FC title

### Players vs. Copies Sold Distinction
"Players" as reported by EA includes:
- People who purchased the game (actual copy sales)
- EA Play / EA Play Pro subscribers who accessed the game
- Free trial / demo users
- PlayStation Plus recipients (FC 24 given away May 2024)
- GeForce Now subscribers
- Free weekend participants

This means reported "player" counts are significantly higher than actual copies sold.

### Revenue vs. Copy Sales
EA's FC/FIFA revenue is dominated by Ultimate Team (FUT) microtransactions, not base game copy sales. The "almost 2 billion in revenue" cited in post 1olq87u represents total EA Sports revenue including all live-service income. Copy sale revenue is a fraction of this total.

### Rapid Discounting Pattern
All three FC titles (24, 25, 26) were discounted 50% within approximately 6-8 weeks of launch. This appears to be a deliberate strategy to maximize the player base for microtransaction revenue rather than to maximize copy sale revenue.
