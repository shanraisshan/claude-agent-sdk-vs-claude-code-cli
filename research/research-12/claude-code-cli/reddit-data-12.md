## Per-Game Sales Summary

### FIFA 23 (2022-2023)
- **Copies Sold**: Estimated 10-12 million copies (lifetime)
- **Sources**: FIFA 23 was the last FIFA-branded title and benefited from the "last ever FIFA" marketing. EA reported strong engagement. The FIFA franchise historically sells 10+ million copies per annual release. FIFA 22 reportedly had over 10 million players in its first week. FIFA 23 likely matched or exceeded this given the "last FIFA" branding boost.
- **Reddit Evidence**: Multiple posts reference FIFA 23 as a major seller. The game was pulled from digital stores when FC 24 launched (Post 1), suggesting EA wanted to push players to the new title. The "last FIFA" narrative drove additional interest.
- **Confidence**: Medium - no exact Reddit-sourced sales figure found, estimated based on franchise historical data discussed on Reddit.

### EA Sports FC 24 (2023-2024)
- **Copies Sold**: Estimated 11-14 million copies (lifetime)
- **Sources**: FC 24 was the first game under the new EA Sports FC branding. Despite the name change, it performed well commercially. EA's financial reports (discussed on Reddit) indicated the FC franchise continued to be a major revenue driver. FC 24 was referenced as a comparison point when FC 25 underperformed. The monthly active users chart (Post 5) shows FC 24 had significantly higher engagement than FC 25. Being the top-selling game in Europe and a consistent performer in the US market suggests strong unit sales.
- **Reddit Evidence**: Posts about FC 25's underperformance implicitly reference FC 24 as the benchmark. FC 24 engagement was higher across all months compared to FC 25. Comments suggest FC 24 was a solid commercial performer.
- **Confidence**: Medium - no exact Reddit-sourced sales figure found, estimated based on franchise patterns and relative performance discussions.

### EA Sports FC 25 (2024-2025)
- **Copies Sold**: Estimated 7-10 million copies (lifetime)
- **Sources**: FC 25 significantly underperformed expectations according to EA's own revised fiscal forecast (Posts 6, 7). EA lost $6 billion in market value partly due to FC 25 underperformance. Monthly active users were notably lower than FC 24 (Post 5). FC 25 received the worst user ratings in franchise history (Post 8). However, it was still the #1 best-selling game in Europe for H1 2025 (Post 10), indicating it still sold millions of copies despite the decline.
- **Reddit Evidence**: Multiple high-upvoted posts confirm FC 25 underperformance. Jason Schreier reported EA slashing forecasts (Post 6). EA lost $6B in market value (Post 7). Despite this, FC 25 still topped European charts (Post 10).
