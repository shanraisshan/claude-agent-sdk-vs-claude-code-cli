# Research Report: FIFA / EA Sports FC Game Sales (2023–2025)
## Iteration 12 — Claude Agent SDK

---

## Executive Summary

EA's FIFA franchise was rebranded to **EA Sports FC** starting in September 2023 after EA's FIFA naming license expired. Three titles were released in the 2023–2025 window: **EA Sports FC 24** (2023), **EA Sports FC 25** (2024), and **EA Sports FC 26** (2025). No other publisher released a competing FIFA-branded game during this period.

EA does not publicly disclose unit sales (copies sold) for individual FC titles. They report "player counts" (inflated by EA Play, Game Pass, and trial users) and "net bookings" (bundling copy sales with live-service revenue). The estimates below apply a ~37.5% discount to EA's player counts and incorporate the well-documented FC 25 underperformance that cost EA ~$6 billion in market value and triggered a ~20% stock crash.

**Total estimated copy-sale revenue (2023–2025): $1.54 billion across ~22 million copies.**

---

## A. Revenue Table

**Methodology:**
- **Retail price:** $70 USD (standard current-gen pricing, 2023+)
- **Player-count discount:** EA-reported player counts reduced by ~37.5% to estimate actual copy purchasers (removing EA Play subscribers, Game Pass users, free trial players)
- **FC 25 decline:** EA slashed FY2025 guidance by $500–650M primarily due to FC 25, lost $6B in market cap, stock dropped ~20%. A ~38% decline from FC 24 is applied.
- **FC 26:** Still in active sales window (~6 months post-launch); conservative full-lifecycle estimate applied.

| # | Title | Year | Copies Sold (Est.) | Revenue (USD) | Confidence |
|---|-------|------|--------------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | EA Sports FC 24 | 2023 | ~10.5 million | $735,000,000 | Medium |
| 2 | EA Sports FC 25 | 2024 | ~6.5 million | $455,000,000 | Medium |
| 3 | EA Sports FC 26 | 2025 | ~5.0 million | $350,000,000 | Low |
| **TOTAL** | | | **~22.0 million** | **$1.54 B** | |

## Per-Title Detailed Analysis

### 1. EA Sports FC 24 (Released September 29, 2023)

**Estimated Copies Sold: ~10.5 million | Revenue: $735M | Confidence: Medium**

**Raw Data from Reddit:**
- 11.3 million players globally in first week (EA official, cited on r/4PlayerS via GamesIndustry.biz)
- 14.5 million active players in first month (r/M8X_GAMENEWS, Nov 2023)
- New players up ~20% year-over-year (EA Sports president Cam Weber, cited on Reddit)
- 2nd biggest UK retail launch of 2023
- FUT revenue up high-single digits YoY in first 4 weeks (EA Q2 FY2024 earnings call, r/EASportsFC)
- EA had a record FY Q1 (Apr–Jun 2023) with net bookings +21% YoY (r/PS5, 831 upvotes)

**Estimation Logic:**
- 14.5M first-month players × 0.625 (37.5% discount for non-purchasers) ≈ **9.1M first-month purchasers**
- FIFA/FC titles have a strong sales tail through the holiday season and into the following year
- With continued sales through 2024 (before FC 25 launch), lifecycle total estimated at **~10.5M copies**
- FC 24 was considered commercially successful — no negative financial signals from EA
- The ~20% YoY new player growth and "record quarter" language support strong performance
- 10.5M × $70 = **$735M**

---

### 2. EA Sports FC 25 (Released September 27, 2024)

**Estimated Copies Sold: ~6.5 million | Revenue: $455M | Confidence: Medium**

**Raw Data from Reddit:**
- EA slashed FY2025 guidance from $7.5–7.8B to $7.0–7.15B (~$450–650M shortfall) — r/stocks (313 upvotes, 97% ratio)
- FC 25 explicitly named as **primary underperformer** (Jason Schreier, r/PS5 at 1,500 upvotes; r/pcgaming at 1,001 upvotes)
- EA lost **~$6 billion in market capitalization** in January 2025 (r/Games at 1,955 upvotes; r/pcmasterrace at 3,598 upvotes)
- EA stock dropped **~20% total** (7% initial + further after-hours decline) — r/stocks, r/Games_Piracy
- Game was **50% off ($35) within ~7 weeks** of launch (mid-November 2024) — r/PS5 comment (358 upvotes)
- EA projected a "mid-single-digit decline" in live services revenue — r/Games_Piracy citing EA press release
- Q3 FY2025 (Oct–Dec 2024) net bookings: ~$2.215B vs $2.4–2.55B guidance — r/stocks
- Despite underperformance: **#1 best-selling game in ALL 17 tracked European countries** for H1 2025 (r/Games, 191 upvotes, citing VGChartz)
- 905,000 copies sold on PlayStation alone in June 2025 (at steep discount) — r/PlaySwapM4G
- Described as "the worst FIFA/FC game they've ever released" (r/pcmasterrace, 238 upvotes)

**Estimation Logic:**
- FC 25 caused EA to lose $6B in market value and slash forecasts — this is **not a marginal decline**
- A ~38% decline from FC 24's estimated 10.5M → **~6.5M copies**
- This 38% decline is consistent with:
  - EA slashing ~$500–650M from full-year guidance (FC 25 + Dragon Age combined)
  - Game being discounted 50% within 7 weeks (indicating severe demand shortfall)
  - EA stock dropping 20% (investors pricing in significant franchise deterioration)
  - Jason Schreier and multiple high-engagement Reddit threads describing "underperformance" and "failure"
- Despite the decline, FC 25 was still #1 in all of Europe H1 2025 — the franchise floor remains high
- 6.5M × $70 = **$455M**

---

### 3. EA Sports FC 26 (Released ~August 30, 2025)

**Estimated Copies Sold: ~5.0 million (conservative lifecycle) | Revenue: $350M | Confidence: Low**

**Raw Data from Reddit:**
- Leaked/confirmed release: Ultimate Edition Aug 23, Standard Edition Aug 30, 2025 (~1 month earlier than usual) — r/FIFANEWS
- Official reveal trailer: July 16, 2025 (r/EASportsFC, 745 upvotes)
- **Lost UK physical sales at launch to Ghost of Yotei** (r/gaming, 1,244 upvotes, citing PushSquare)
- **Lost European launch premium sales to Battlefield 6** (also EA) — r/gaming, 892 upvotes, citing TheGameBusiness
- PC input delay issues at launch generated a mega-thread (r/EASportsFC, 727 upvotes, 99% ratio)
- Released under the shadow of EA's $55B Saudi PIF acquisition (announced September 2025)
- Early release possibly motivated by GTA 6 competition

**Estimation Logic:**
- FC 26 is still in its active sales window (~6 months post-launch as of February 2026)
- Launch signals are weak: lost UK physical to a new IP, lost European premium sales to sibling title BF6
- PC technical issues at launch may have suppressed early digital sales
- Franchise trajectory is clearly downward (FC 24 → FC 25 was a ~38% decline)
- Conservative full-lifecycle estimate of **~5.0M copies** (may reach 6M by end of lifecycle, but remaining conservative per methodology)
- Low confidence due to: recency, no player count data from EA, no financial reporting since EA entered acquisition process
- EA's $55B acquisition by Saudi PIF may reduce future financial disclosures significantly
- 5.0M × $70 = **$350M**

## Key Contextual Findings

### EA's FIFA → FC Transition
- FIFA 23 (Sept 2022) was the last game under the "FIFA" brand after EA's licensing deal expired
- EA rebranded to "EA Sports FC" starting with FC 24 (Sept 2023)
- Previous FIFA-branded games were delisted from Steam upon FC 24's launch (r/gaming, 6,154 upvotes)
- 2K Games reportedly developing a competing FIFA-branded game (mentioned in r/Games comments), but no product shipped during 2023–2025

### EA's $55 Billion Acquisition (September 2025)
- EA agreed to be acquired by Saudi Arabia's PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners for $55B ($210/share)
- PIF will control 93.4% of EA post-acquisition
- Deal financed with $36.4B in equity and ~$20B in debt
- Jason Schreier warned of "aggressive cost cutting" ahead (r/TwoBestFriendsPlay, 488 upvotes)
- Largest gaming acquisition in history
- Expected to close Q1 FY2027 — future financial disclosures will be significantly reduced

### Franchise Sales Trajectory
| Title | Year | First-Week Players | Est. Copies Sold | Trend |
|-------|------|--------------------|------------------|-------|
| FIFA 23 | 2022 | 10.3M | (excluded — pre-2023 release) | Baseline |
| EA Sports FC 24 | 2023 | 11.3M | ~10.5M | +10% launch growth |
| EA Sports FC 25 | 2024 | Not disclosed | ~6.5M | **−38% decline** |
| EA Sports FC 26 | 2025 | Not disclosed | ~5.0M | **−23% decline** (est.) |

The franchise peaked with FC 24 and entered a significant decline with FC 25. FC 26's trajectory remains uncertain.

## Caveats and Limitations

1. **EA does not disclose unit sales.** All "copies sold" figures are estimates derived from player counts (discounted for non-purchasers) and financial performance indicators. No Reddit post contained a definitive "X million copies sold" figure for any FC title.

2. **Revenue = copy sales only.** Excludes Ultimate Team microtransactions, DLC, loot boxes, and in-app purchases — which historically constitute the **majority** of EA Sports FC franchise revenue (estimated 70–80%+).

3. **$70 flat rate is a simplification.** FC 25 was heavily discounted within weeks; the actual average selling price was likely well below $70. FC 24 was added to PlayStation Plus after ~7 months. Actual revenue per copy is lower than these figures suggest.

4. **FC 26 estimate is speculative.** The game had been on sale for ~6 months at the research cutoff. The lifecycle estimate could shift in either direction.

5. **FIFA 23 excluded.** Released September 30, 2022 — outside the 2023–2025 release window per methodology rules, despite active sales continuing into 2023.

6. **No FIFA-branded competitor shipped.** A rumored 2K/FIFA partnership was discussed on Reddit but no product was confirmed as released during 2023–2025.
