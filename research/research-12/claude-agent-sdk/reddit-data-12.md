- **Score:** 104 (91% upvote ratio)
- **Date:** January 27, 2025
- **URL:** https://reddit.com/r/fut/comments/1ibblkv/
- **Content:** "Very interesting article showing that indeed FC25 is doing bad numbers. Some say it's the rebranding but I believe it's the gameplay. Too many patches changing the game completely instead of sticking to one philosophy. It also seems like people are buying less packs, which is driving their revenue down."

That's both game sales and in game purchases. They just expected higher yields." [Referenced: https://www.sportico.com/business/tech/2025/ea-sports-stock-fifa-eafc-1234825114/]
  - u/Skysflies (19 pts): "Falling short of expectations and doing badly are not the same thing."

- **Content (Full):** "Electronic Arts slashed its full-year bookings guidance on Wednesday, blaming the shortfall on underperforming games, notably its soccer franchise, EA Sports FC.

For the fiscal third quarter, which ended Dec. 31, EA said it expects to report about $2.215 billion in net bookings, versus previous guidance of $2.4 billion to $2.55 billion.

EA said it expects net bookings for the full fiscal year, ending March 31, of between $7 billion and $7.15 billion, below previous guidance of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion. EA says net bookings include physical game sales as well as revenue from online games. The warning reveals weakness in the most prominent soccer video game franchise since 1993. It used to fall under the FIFA branding, but in 2022 EA's deal with FIFA ended and the last two EA soccer games have been sold..."

  - u/vKEVUv (245 pts): "EA always had big internal expectations so a fact they only forecasted 3 million 'players' during initial sales window for AAA Dragon Age RPG... means even they had tempered expectations by default and game still didn't meet those... Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with GeForce Now subscription"

## Per-Game Summary: Copies Sold / Player Count Data

### FIFA 23 (Released September 30, 2022 -- lifecycle extends into 2023)

| Metric | Figure | Source on Reddit |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| First week players | 10.3 million | r/4PlayerS post citing VGC |
| Total copies sold | Not found on Reddit | No Reddit post with total unit sales discovered |

**Notes:** FIFA 23 was described as having a "record-breaking launch" at the time. It was the last game under the FIFA brand. No specific total copies-sold figure was found on Reddit. EA does not typically disclose exact unit sales for individual titles; they report "net bookings" which combines game sales with live-service revenue. FIFA 23's lifecycle continued well into 2023 before FC 24 launched in September 2023.

### EA Sports FC 24 (Released September 29, 2023)

| Metric | Figure | Source on Reddit |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| First week players | 11.3 million globally | r/4PlayerS post citing GamesIndustry.biz |
| First month active players | 14.5 million | r/M8X_GAMENEWS post |
| New players vs prior year | Up ~20% YoY | EA Sports president Cam Weber, cited in Reddit post |
| UK retail launch ranking | 2nd biggest of 2023 | GamesIndustry.biz, cited on Reddit |
| FUT revenue (first 4 weeks) | Up high-single digits YoY | EA earnings call, referenced in r/EASportsFC comment |
| Total copies sold | Not explicitly found on Reddit | EA reports "players" not "copies sold" |

**Notes:** EA deliberately uses "players" rather than "copies sold" which inflates numbers by including EA Play/EA Access subscribers and trial users. The 11.3 million first-week figure and 14.5 million first-month figure include all player types across all platforms. No Reddit post contained a specific total copies-sold number for FC 24. FC 24 was generally considered commercially successful, with EA reporting strong fiscal results through 2024.

### EA Sports FC 25 (Released September 27, 2024)

| Metric | Figure | Source on Reddit |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| PlayStation copies sold (June 2025) | 905,000 in one month | r/PlaySwapM4G post title |
| Europe H1 2025 ranking | #1 best-selling game in all 17 tracked countries | r/Games post citing VGChartz |
| EA FY2025 Q3 net bookings (Oct-Dec 2024) | ~$2.215B (vs $2.4-2.55B guidance) | r/stocks post |
| EA FY2025 full-year guidance | Cut to $7.0-7.15B (from $7.5-7.8B) | r/stocks post |
| EA market cap loss from underperformance | $6 billion | r/Games, r/pcmasterrace, r/pcgaming posts citing VGC |
| EA stock drop | ~20% total (7% initial + more after-hours) | Multiple Reddit posts |
| Time to 50% discount | ~7 weeks after launch (half price by mid-November 2024) | r/PS5 comment |
| Live services decline | "Mid-single-digit decline" projected | r/Games_Piracy post citing EA press release |
| Total copies sold | Not explicitly found on Reddit | Not disclosed |

**Notes:** EA Sports FC 25 is the most heavily discussed title on Reddit in terms of commercial performance -- and the discussion is overwhelmingly negative. EA explicitly named FC 25 as a primary contributor to their fiscal year guidance being slashed. The game was described as "doing bad numbers" and was discounted to 50% off within 7 weeks of launch. Despite this, it was still the #1 best-selling game in all 17 tracked European countries for H1 2025, suggesting the franchise's baseline remains enormous even in a "down" year. No specific total copies-sold figure was found on Reddit; EA reports "net bookings" rather than unit sales.

### EA Sports FC 26 (Released ~August/September 2025)

| Metric | Figure | Source on Reddit |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Release date (leaked) | Ultimate Edition: Aug 23, 2025; Standard: Aug 30, 2025 | r/FIFANEWS leak post |
| UK physical sales at launch | Lost to Ghost of Yotei (physical only) | r/gaming post citing PushSquare |
| European launch premium sales | Lost to Battlefield 6 (also EA) | r/gaming post citing TheGameBusiness |
| Official reveal | July 16, 2025 | r/EASportsFC reveal trailer post |
| Total copies sold | Not found on Reddit | Too recent for comprehensive sales data |

**Notes:** EA Sports FC 26 was officially revealed in July 2025 and released ahead of its traditional late-September window, possibly to avoid GTA 6 competition. At launch, it lost in UK physical sales to Ghost of Yotei and lost in European premium sales to Battlefield 6 (also an EA title). No total copies-sold figures were found on Reddit. The game was released under the shadow of EA's $55 billion acquisition by Saudi Arabia's PIF, announced September 2025.

## Data Limitations

1. **EA does not publicly disclose specific unit sales (copies sold) for individual FIFA/FC titles.** They report "net bookings" (which combines physical sales, digital sales, and live service revenue) and "player counts" (which include EA Play/Game Pass subscribers, free trial players, etc.).

2. **Reddit is not a primary source for precise sales figures.** Most sales data on Reddit comes from:
   - EA earnings calls/press releases (discussed in Reddit posts)
   - Third-party tracking (VGChartz, NPD/Circana) mentioned in comments
   - UK physical chart data (GfK/ISFE)
   - Steam player count data (which represents a small minority of the total player base)

3. **Player counts are not the same as copies sold.** EA reports "players" which includes people playing through EA Play, PlayStation Plus, Xbox Game Pass, and free trials -- not just people who purchased a copy.

4. **No specific copy-sales figures in millions were found on Reddit** for any of the EA Sports FC titles (24, 25, 26). This data does not appear to exist in publicly available Reddit discussions, likely because EA has not disclosed it. The closest data points are player counts (which overcount) and financial metrics (net bookings, which combine multiple revenue streams).
