- **Content:** EA lost $6 billion in market value following disclosure that both EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard underperformed sales expectations.
- **Top Comment (1145 upvotes):** "Honestly, the thing that surprises me most about this news was how realistic EA's expectations were for the sales. 3 million should be more than obtainable for a high budget AAA fantasy RPG nowadays. I do wonder how much more of a leash they're going to give Bioware. Andromeda, Anthem, and Veilguard is a pretty rough decade of output."
- **Comment (470 upvotes):** "Most of this is because of FC doing badly. They've made a shit ton of money from that game and it has helped them through other flops. To see those numbers going down is very bad"
- **Comment (189 upvotes):** "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual. Like the last 2 releases had the new anticheat that has been buggy as shit, they still are charging the full price even though they haven't added anything of value really in the last few releases"
