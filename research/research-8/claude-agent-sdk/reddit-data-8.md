# SECTION 3: PER-GAME SALES DATA SUMMARIES

## Game 1: FIFA 23
- **Release date:** September 30, 2022
- **Platforms:** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch (Legacy Edition)
- **Active during 2023:** Yes -- the current title entering 2023; benefited enormously from 2022 FIFA World Cup
- **Last FIFA-branded game:** Yes -- the final game under the FIFA license before EA Sports FC rebrand
- **Delisted:** September 2023 (all FIFA-branded games pulled from digital storefronts)

### Copies Sold Data Found on Reddit:
- **No specific copy sales figure found on Reddit for FIFA 23.**
- Reddit confirms FIFA 23 was the fastest-selling game in Europe (Post M: Hogwarts Legacy qualified as fastest "that isn't FIFA")
- EA's Q1 FY24 (April-June 2023) was a record quarter with 21% net bookings growth, driven partly by FIFA 23's ongoing lifecycle (Post Q)
- FC 24 Steam player count was down 30% from FIFA 23 (Post E), suggesting FIFA 23 had unusually high engagement (World Cup boost)
- Historical franchise context from Reddit: FIFA 13 sold 7.4M copies first month, 15M total; FIFA 18 sold ~6M first week

### Best Available Estimate:
Based on franchise historical performance, World Cup boost, and Europe #1 status, likely in the range of **10-12+ million copies** in the active sales window. EA does not publicly disclose per-title unit sales. The franchise historically sells 10-15M copies per annual title.

## Game 2: EA Sports FC 24
- **Release date:** September 29, 2023
- **Platforms:** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch (Legacy Edition)
- **Active during 2023-2024:** Released late September 2023
- **First game under EA Sports FC brand**

### Copies Sold Data Found on Reddit:
- **No specific copy sales figure found on Reddit for FC 24.**
- UK physical sales down 30% vs FIFA 23 (Post A). Multiple commenters noted this was physical-only and digital may have compensated.
- Steam player count down ~30% vs FIFA 23 (Post E). But EA's November 2023 earnings call reported "double-digit growth in new players" and "FUT revenue was up high-single digits YoY" in first 4 weeks (commenter in Post E, score: 10).
- FC 24 had "sizable increase in ultimate edition pre-orders" compared to FIFA 23 (commenter in Post E, score: 167).
- FC 24 was 55% digital in Europe (Post K article data).
- Article in Post K confirms "the newer games all sold fewer games than their predecessors" -- implying FC 24 sold fewer than FIFA 23.
- The name change from FIFA to EA Sports FC caused significant consumer confusion (multiple commenters across posts).

### Conflicting Signals:
- Physical sales and Steam data suggest decline from FIFA 23
- But EA reported "double-digit growth in new players" at November 2023 earnings
- "Players" metric includes EA Play and trial users, not just buyers
- World Cup boost inflated FIFA 23 numbers, making the comparison unfavorable

### Best Available Estimate:
Based on the conflicting data -- physical decline but EA-reported player growth -- likely in the range of **8-12 million copies**. The actual unit sales may be lower than FIFA 23 (confirmed by Post K article) but not catastrophically so due to digital growth offsetting physical decline.

## Game 3: EA Sports FC 25
- **Release date:** September 27, 2024
- **Platforms:** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch (Legacy Edition)
- **Active during 2024-2025**

### Copies Sold Data Found on Reddit:
- **No specific copy sales figure found on Reddit for FC 25.**
- **CONFIRMED UNDERPERFORMER** based on multiple major Reddit posts:
  1. EA slashed fiscal year forecast (Posts C/C2, January 2025)
  2. EA lost $6 billion in market cap (Post B, January 2025)
  3. EA Q3 FY25 revenue fell to $1.88B from $1.94B (Post D, February 2025)
  4. Bloomberg: "EA says bookings slid on weakness in soccer" (Post S, January 2025)
- FC 25 was discounted to half price within 2 months of launch (Post C, commenter score: 358)
- FC 25 was the worst user-rated game in franchise history (Post I)
- FC 25 was 62% digital in Europe, up from 55% for FC 24 (Post K) -- biggest digital shift seen
- Article in Post K confirms "the newer games all sold fewer games than their predecessors"
- Despite underperformance, FC 25 was still #1 best-selling game in Europe H1 2025, topping all 17 tracked countries (Post J)
- FC 25 was added to Xbox Game Pass in June 2025 (Post O), ~8 months after launch

### Best Available Estimate:
FC 25 clearly sold fewer copies than FC 24 (multiple sources confirm this). The $6B market cap loss and fiscal year forecast slash indicate the decline was significant and unexpected. However, it was still Europe's top seller. Estimated range: **6-9 million copies**, representing a meaningful decline from FC 24 but still large absolute numbers.

## Game 4: EA Sports FC 26
- **Release date:** September 2025 (early access ~Sep 18-19, full launch ~Sep 26, 2025)
- **Platforms:** PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC
- **Active during 2025-present:** The current title

### Copies Sold Data Found on Reddit:
- **No specific copy sales figure found on Reddit for FC 26.**
- FC 26 was beaten by Ghost of Yotei in UK physical sales at launch (Post F, October 2025)
- FC 26 was beaten by Battlefield 6 in European premium launch sales (Post G, October 2025). BF6 "even beat launch sales of EA Sports FC 26."
- FC 26 topped European Black Friday 2025 sales (Post H, December 2025)
- FC 26 had significant PC input delay issues at launch (Post L megathread)
- FC 26 reveal was July 16, 2025 (Post N). Beta in June 2025.

### Additional Context:
- Being outsold at European launch by BF6 and at UK physical launch by Ghost of Yotei is historically unusual for the FIFA/FC franchise, which has typically dominated both metrics.
- However, FC 26 recovered to top Black Friday sales, suggesting holiday discounting drove volume.
- Very recent release (~5 months old); comprehensive sales data unlikely to be available yet.

### Best Available Estimate:
No specific figure available. The declining trend from FC 24 to FC 25 appears to continue with FC 26, given it lost traditional launch-week market dominance. However, Black Friday performance suggests resilience. No Reddit source provides unit estimates.

# SECTION 5: SUMMARY TABLE

| Game | Release Date | Specific Copy Sales on Reddit? | Key Reddit Evidence | Estimated Range |
|------|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| FIFA 23 | Sep 30, 2022 | NO | #1 in Europe; World Cup boost; record EA quarter | ~10-12M+ copies |
| EA Sports FC 24 | Sep 29, 2023 | NO | UK physical -30%; Steam -30%; EA claims double-digit player growth; sold fewer than FIFA 23 per article | ~8-12M copies |
| EA Sports FC 25 | Sep 27, 2024 | NO | Confirmed underperformer; $6B market cap loss; fiscal forecast slashed; half price in 2 months; worst ratings ever; still #1 Europe H1 2025 | ~6-9M copies |
| EA Sports FC 26 | Sep 2025 | NO | Beaten at launch by BF6 and Ghost of Yotei; topped Black Friday; too recent for total figures | Unknown (declining trend likely) |

**Critical Finding:** EA does not publicly disclose per-title unit sales for the FIFA/EA Sports FC franchise. They report "players" (which includes EA Play, Game Pass, and free trials) and "net bookings" rather than copies sold. No Reddit post found with verified, specific copy sales numbers for any title in the 2023-2025 range. All estimates above are derived from relative performance data, financial reports, franchise historical norms, and community analysis discussed on Reddit.
