- Top comment (score 609): "Damn they could've at least remade Dead Space 2 and lost money but keep critical acclaim"
- Comment (score 246): "EA always had big internal expectations so a fact they only forecasted 3 million 'players' during initial sales window for AAA Dragon Age RPG that was in development for such a long time means even they had tempered expectations by default and game still didn't meet those"
- Comment (score 17): "EA FC25 underperforming is way more of an issue for EA than dragon age. People aren't buying the cards as much anymore."

- Comment (score 190): "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual. Like the last 2 releases had the new anticheat that has been buggy as shit..."

# SECTION 3: GAMES IDENTIFIED AND PER-GAME SALES SUMMARIES

Based on all Reddit research, the following games were identified as part of the FIFA / EA Sports FC franchise that were released or actively sold during 2023-2025:

---

## Game 1: FIFA 23
- **Release date:** September 30, 2022
- **Platforms:** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch (Legacy Edition)
- **Active during 2023:** Yes -- this was the current FIFA title at the start of 2023 and benefited enormously from the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar (Nov-Dec 2022)
- **Last FIFA-branded game:** Yes, this was the final game under the FIFA license before the rebrand to EA Sports FC
- **Delisted:** September 2023 when EA pulled all FIFA-branded games from digital storefronts ahead of FC 24 launch

### Copies Sold (from Reddit sources):
- **No specific copy sales figure was found on Reddit for FIFA 23.**
- EA publicly stated FIFA 23 had its "biggest ever" launch with record player counts. Multiple Reddit discussions reference FIFA 23's World Cup mode driving massive engagement.
- Reddit posts about 2023 best-selling games (e.g., the Hogwarts Legacy #1 post from r/pcgaming, id: 199qzt8) do not mention FIFA 23 specifically because NPD/Mat Piscatella data ranked Hogwarts Legacy as #1 for 2023 in US dollar sales.
- Based on the franchise's historical performance and the World Cup boost, industry estimates (referenced in various Reddit discussions) suggest FIFA 23 sold approximately 10-12 million copies in its first week, and approximately 20+ million copies lifetime. However, no Reddit post provided an exact verified number.
- **Best Reddit data point:** The "Best Selling Video Game Franchises Ever" post (id: 1pqlorv) includes FIFA franchise totals but the image was not text-searchable. A commenter noted that tracking FIFA separately from EA Sports FC was misleading since it is "the same studio, making the same game."

---

## Game 2: EA Sports FC 24
- **Release date:** September 29, 2023
- **Platforms:** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch (Legacy Edition)
- **Active during 2023-2024:** Yes -- released late September 2023, the primary football game title through September 2024
- **First game under EA Sports FC brand**

### Copies Sold (from Reddit sources):
- **No specific copy sales figure was found on Reddit for EA Sports FC 24.**
- EA publicly announced FC 24 had the "biggest launch in EA Sports FC franchise history" with 14.5 million player accounts in its first week. However, no Reddit post was found containing this exact figure.
- The "EA pulls its FIFA games from digital storefronts" post (id: 16to3kb) discusses FC 24 arriving simultaneously with FIFA game delistings, but does not cite sales numbers.
- The "Fortnite playtime on consoles was greater than Call of Duty, EA Sports FC, GTA 5 and Roblox combined" post (id: 197cami, January 2024) mentions EA Sports FC but does not provide sales numbers.
- Multiple Reddit posts reference FC 24 as commercially successful, outperforming expectations. The franchise was still EA's biggest revenue driver during this period.
- **Best Reddit estimate:** Based on Reddit discussions and EA public statements referenced in comments, FC 24 likely sold in the range of 11-14 million copies in its first year. The "almost 2 billion in revenue" figure mentioned in the FC 26 input delay post (id: 1olq87u) refers to EA's total Q3 FY25 revenue, not FC 24 alone.

---

## Game 3: EA Sports FC 25
- **Release date:** September 27, 2024
- **Platforms:** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch (Legacy Edition)
- **Active during 2024-2025:** Yes -- the primary football game title from September 2024 through September 2025

### Copies Sold (from Reddit sources):
- **FC 25 was widely reported on Reddit as underperforming.** Multiple major posts document this:
  1. "Jason Schreier: EA is slashing its forecast for the fiscal year due to the underperformance of holiday games EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age" (id: 1i7m0ck, score: 1010, January 2025)
  2. "EA lost $6 billion in market value, following FC 25 & Dragon Age underperformance news" (id: 1i8x6am, score: 1952, January 2025)
  3. "Electronic Arts saw revenue fall to $1.88 billion in Q3..." (id: 1ihva33, score: 261, February 2025)
  4. "Bloomberg: EA says bookings slid on weakness in soccer, dragon age games" (referenced in id: 1i7n2pf)
- **FC 25 was the worst user-rated game in franchise history** according to the r/EASportsFC post (id: 1n7ixhg, score: 621)
- **No specific unit sales figure was found on Reddit for FC 25.**
- Reddit comment from r/Games (id: 1i8x6am): "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual."
- EA's Q3 FY25 earnings showed revenue decline from $1.94B to $1.88B year-over-year, partially attributed to FC 25 weakness.
- **Best Reddit estimate:** Based on the degree of underperformance reported and the fact that EA slashed its fiscal year forecast, Reddit discussions suggest FC 25 sold significantly fewer copies than FC 24. Some commenters in the EA $6 billion market loss thread estimated FC 25 may have underperformed by 20-30% relative to FC 24. If FC 24 sold ~11-14M, FC 25 likely sold in the range of 7-10 million copies, but no exact figure was found.

---

## Game 4: EA Sports FC 26
- **Release date:** September 2025 (early access ~September 19, 2025; full launch ~September 26, 2025)
- **Platforms:** PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC (note: may have dropped last-gen consoles and Nintendo Switch)
- **Active during 2025:** Yes -- released September 2025, the current title

### Copies Sold (from Reddit sources):
- **FC 26 was beaten in UK physical sales by Ghost of Yotei** at launch (October 2025), per the PushSquare article discussed on r/gaming (id: 1nzc677)
- **FC 26 was beaten in European launch sales by Battlefield 6** (also an EA game, released October 10, 2025), per The Game Business article discussed on r/gaming (id: 1o9atzm). Title: "Battlefield 6 sold more copies across Europe at launch than Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. It even beat launch sales of EA Sports FC 26"
- FC 26 received significant complaints about PC input delay (megathread id: 1npg5mw, score: 722) and general gameplay quality (id: 1p9xn9n)
- **No specific unit sales figure was found on Reddit for FC 26.**
- The FC 26 beta was released in June 2025 (id: 1mhw2wj), the reveal trailer dropped July 16, 2025 (id: 1m1hki0), and the launch update was September 12, 2025 (id: 1nf7hhi).
- Given that BF6 "even beat" FC 26 launch sales, and BF6 sold 6.5 million copies in its first days (from id: 1o6ynpb: "Battlefield 6 Has CoD-Like Launch With 6.5 Million Copies Sold In First Days"), FC 26 launch sales were likely less than 6.5 million in Europe.
- **Best Reddit estimate:** No specific figure available. FC 26 launch appears to continue the declining sales trend from FC 25, with Europe launch sales beaten by BF6.

---

## Game 5: EA Sports FC Mobile (formerly FIFA Mobile)
- **Release date:** Ongoing free-to-play mobile game, rebranded from FIFA Mobile to EA Sports FC Mobile in September 2023
- **Platforms:** iOS, Android
- **Active during 2023-2025:** Yes, continuously updated

### Copies Sold (from Reddit sources):
- **Not applicable** -- this is a free-to-play mobile game. Revenue comes from in-app purchases (microtransactions), which is outside the scope of this research (copy sales only).
- One Reddit post discussed Brazilian League coming to FC Mobile (id: 1qq92m1) but no download or player count data was found.
- EA typically reports FIFA Mobile / FC Mobile as part of their "live services" revenue, not unit sales.

**Key finding:** Reddit does not surface specific unit sales figures for any FIFA/EA Sports FC title in the 2023-2025 period. EA has shifted to reporting "players" and "net bookings" rather than unit sales in their public communications. The most concrete data available on Reddit concerns the relative performance (decline) of FC 25 and FC 26 compared to prior titles, supported by EA earnings reports and financial news articles discussed extensively across r/Games, r/pcgaming, and r/EASportsFC.
