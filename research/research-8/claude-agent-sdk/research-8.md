# Research Report: FIFA / EA Sports FC Franchise — Copy Sales & Revenue (2023–2025)

## Methodology

EA does not publicly disclose per-title unit sales for the FIFA/EA Sports FC franchise. Instead, EA reports "players" (which includes EA Play, Game Pass, and free trial users) and "net bookings." No Reddit post contained verified, specific copy sales numbers for any title in the 2023–2025 window.

Estimates below are derived from:
- **Franchise baseline**: Modern FIFA titles average ~10.8M copies sold per annual cycle
- **World Cup boost**: FIFA 23 coincided with the Qatar 2022 World Cup, boosting sales 20–25% above baseline → ~13–14M copies
- **Player-to-copies conversion**: EA-reported "players" are discounted to 75–80% to approximate actual purchasers (76% midpoint used). This conversion already represents full lifecycle sales — no additional lifecycle bump applied.
- **Underperformance rule**: FC 25 triggered EA's fiscal forecast slash (~$500M+), $6B+ market cap loss, and 50% discounting within 2 months → estimated at 70–73% of prior year's copies
- **Recovery projection**: FC 26 shows mixed recovery signals (lost launch dominance but topped Black Friday; no fiscal forecast slash) → estimated 15–20% above underperforming predecessor
- **Pricing**: $60 for titles released before 2023 (FIFA 23); $70 for 2023+ titles (FC 24, FC 25, FC 26)
- **Revenue scope**: Physical + digital copy sales only. No microtransactions, DLC, FUT packs, or in-app purchases included.
- **Free-to-play exclusion**: EA Sports FC Mobile / FIFA Mobile is excluded — no copy sales revenue.

## Per-Title Analysis

### 1. FIFA 23 — 13.5M copies, $810M revenue (Confidence: Medium)

- **Released:** September 30, 2022 | **Price:** $60 | **Active through:** September 2023
- **Platforms:** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch
- The final FIFA-branded title before the EA Sports FC rebrand.
- Benefited enormously from the **Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup** (Nov–Dec 2022), which historically drives a 20–25% boost above the franchise's ~10.8M baseline.
- Confirmed as **Europe's fastest-selling game** — Hogwarts Legacy was explicitly qualified as the fastest "that isn't FIFA" (r/Games post 11ky1mc, score: 5,084).
- EA's Q1 FY24 (Apr–Jun 2023) was a **record quarter** with 21% net bookings growth YoY, driven substantially by FIFA 23 (r/pcgaming post 15foxrm, score: 122).
- FC 24's Steam player count was down ~30% from FIFA 23, and multiple sources confirm "newer games all sold fewer" — confirming FIFA 23 was the high-water mark.
- **Calculation:** 10.8M baseline × 1.25 (World Cup boost) ≈ 13.5M copies. Middle of the 13–14M range indicated by the rule.
- Delisted from all digital storefronts in September 2023 when the FIFA license expired.

### 2. EA Sports FC 24 — 11.0M copies, $770M revenue (Confidence: Medium)

- **Released:** September 29, 2023 | **Price:** $70 | **Active through:** September 2024
- **Platforms:** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch
- First game under the EA Sports FC brand after the FIFA license split.
- UK physical launch sales **down 30%** vs FIFA 23 (r/XboxSeriesX post 16xtqme, score: 459). Multiple commenters noted physical sales are declining industry-wide and digital may have partially compensated.
- Steam player count **down ~30%** from FIFA 23 (r/EASportsFC post 18toyd1, score: 582). However, commenters emphasized Steam is a small fraction of the console-dominant player base.
- EA's November 2023 earnings call reported **"double-digit growth in new players"** and FUT revenue **"up high-single digits YoY"** in first 4 weeks (commenter in post 18toyd1, score: 10). However, "players" includes EA Play and trial users.
- Ultimate Edition pre-orders showed a **"sizable increase"** vs FIFA 23 (commenter in post 18toyd1, score: 167).
- The Game Business article (via r/Games post 1k2tg9f, score: 823) confirms **"the newer games all sold fewer games than their predecessors"** — FC 24 sold fewer than FIFA 23.
- FC 24 was **55% digital** in Europe (GSD data cited in post 1k2tg9f).
- **Estimate:** Near franchise baseline (~10.8M), slightly above due to strong franchise momentum but below World Cup-boosted FIFA 23. Confirmed to have sold fewer than FIFA 23. Rounded to 11.0M.

### 3. EA Sports FC 25 — 8.0M copies, $560M revenue (Confidence: Medium)

- **Released:** September 27, 2024 | **Price:** $70 | **Active through:** September 2025
- **Platforms:** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch
- **Confirmed severe underperformer** via multiple high-visibility Reddit posts:
  - EA **slashed fiscal year forecast** by ~$500M+ (r/PS5 post 1i7m1am, score: 1,501; Jason Schreier/Bloomberg)
  - EA **lost $6 billion in market capitalization** (r/Games post 1i8x6am, score: 1,955)
  - Bloomberg headline: **"EA says bookings slid on weakness in soccer, Dragon Age games"** (r/dragonage post 1i7n2pf, score: 2,017)
  - EA Q3 FY25 revenue fell to **$1.88B from $1.94B** YoY, citing FC weakness (r/Games post 1ihva33, score: 260)
- **Half price within 2 months** of launch (r/PS5 post 1i7m1am, top comment, score: 358).
- **Worst user-rated game in franchise history** across Metacritic, Google, and Steam (r/EASportsFC post 1n7ixhg, score: 621).
- Despite all this, FC 25 was still **#1 best-selling game in Europe H1 2025**, topping all 17 tracked countries (r/Games post 1m2vrvv, score: 187).
- FC 25 was **62% digital** in Europe, up from 55% for FC 24 (r/Games post 1k2tg9f) — the biggest digital shift seen in annual sports titles.
- Added to Xbox Game Pass in June 2025 (~8 months post-launch), suggesting premium sales window had closed (r/Games post 1l3yklu, score: 264).
- **Calculation:** Underperformance rule → 70–73% of prior year (11.0M). 11M × 0.73 = 8.03M → rounded to 8.0M.

### 4. EA Sports FC 26 — 9.5M copies (projected), $665M revenue (Confidence: Low)

- **Released:** September 2025 (early access ~Sep 18–19, full launch ~Sep 26) | **Price:** $70
- **Platforms:** PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC (dropped last-gen PS4/Xbox One and Nintendo Switch)
- **Still in active sales window** (~5 months since launch as of February 2026).
- Launch performance was **historically unusual for the franchise**:
  - Beaten by **Ghost of Yotei** in UK physical sales at launch (r/gaming post 1nzc677, score: 1,240)
  - Beaten by **Battlefield 6** in European premium launch sales — "It even beat launch sales of EA Sports FC 26" (r/gaming post 1o9atzm, score: 889)
- However, FC 26 showed recovery momentum:
  - **Topped European Black Friday 2025 sales** alongside Hogwarts Legacy (r/Games post 1pfo1ph, score: 219)
  - **No EA fiscal forecast slash or major market cap loss** reported (unlike FC 25's catastrophic financial signals)
  - Community reception cautiously more positive than FC 25, though technical issues (input delay) tempered enthusiasm (r/EASportsFC post 1olq87u, megathread, score: 1,063)
- **Calculation:** Recovery rule → FC 25 (8.0M) × 1.19 = 9.5M projected full annual lifecycle. Annual sports franchises sell ~85–90% of lifetime copies in first 12 months. The absence of catastrophic financial signals + Black Friday top performance supports modest recovery.

## Key Context from Reddit Research

### EA/FIFA License Split (2023)
- EA and FIFA officially parted ways in Summer 2023 after the FIFA 23 cycle ended
- EA was contractually required to delist all FIFA-branded games from digital storefronts (Sep 2023)
- The franchise continued as "EA Sports FC" starting with FC 24
- FIFA (the organization) licensed its name to 2K Sports for a competing game

### EA Acquisition (2025)
- EA announced acquisition by PIF (Saudi Arabia), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners for $55 billion (Sep 29, 2025)
- Saudi Arabia would own ~93.4% of EA under the buyout plan
- 99% of shareholders approved — deal underscores the enduring value of EA's sports franchises despite declining sales

### Revenue Structure
- 71% of EA's revenue comes from live services (r/pcgaming post un2dll, score: 2,107) — primarily Ultimate Team
- Copy sales revenue ($2.81B estimated across 4 titles) represents only a fraction of total franchise earnings when including FUT microtransactions, which are excluded from this analysis

### Physical vs Digital Shift
- EA Sports FC 24: 55% digital in Europe
- EA Sports FC 25: 62% digital in Europe (biggest shift seen in annual sports titles)
- UK games market: ~90% digital as of 2022
- Physical sales data (UK charts, etc.) is increasingly unreliable as a proxy for total sales
