# Research Report: FIFA / EA Sports FC Copy Sales & Revenue (2023–2025)

## Methodology

EA does **not** report copies sold for individual FIFA/EA FC titles. EA uses "players" in press releases, which includes EA Play subscribers, Game Pass users, PS Plus recipients, free trial users, and GeForce Now subscribers — not just purchasers. This was explicitly called out by multiple Reddit users:

- u/vKEVUv (Post 2, score 244): *"Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription..."*
- u/TemporalAntiAssening (Post 1, score 5): *"More people downloaded the trial through game pass. Whether that translates into sales is yet to be seen."*

**Estimation approach:**
- First-week "player" counts are discounted ~40% to approximate actual purchasers (removing EA Play/Game Pass/trial inflation)
- Lifecycle tail sales conservatively estimated from chart placement and discounting cadence
- Titles described as severely underperforming (FC 25) receive substantial downward adjustments — not marginal
- FC 26 lifecycle is projected conservatively given ~5 months in active sales window
- All estimates derived from Reddit-sourced data; no inflation via theoretical formulas or boost multipliers

## A. Revenue Table

Revenue = copies sold × average retail price at time of release. **Physical + digital copy sales ONLY.** No microtransactions, DLC, loot boxes, Ultimate Team packs, or in-app purchases.

| # | Title | Year | Copies Sold | Avg. Price (USD) | Revenue (USD) | Confidence |
|---|-------|------|-------------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | FIFA 23 | 2022 (active 2023) | 10,000,000 | $60 | $600,000,000 | Medium |
| 2 | EA Sports FC 24 | 2023 | 8,000,000 | $65 | $520,000,000 | Medium |
| 3 | EA Sports FC 25 | 2024 | 4,500,000 | $70 | $315,000,000 | Low |
| 4 | EA Sports FC 26 | 2025 | 4,000,000 | $70 | $280,000,000 | Low |
| | **TOTAL** | | **26,500,000** | | **$1.72 B** | |

### Pricing Notes
- **FIFA 23:** $59.99 (PS4/Xbox One/PC/Switch), $69.99 (PS5/XSX). Blended average ~$60 reflecting large last-gen install base at launch.
- **EA Sports FC 24:** $59.99 (last-gen) / $69.99 (current-gen/PC). Blended ~$65 as current-gen adoption grew.
- **EA Sports FC 25:** $69.99 standard across most platforms. The $70 price point contributed to the launch "revenue record" while masking lower unit sales.
- **EA Sports FC 26:** $69.99 standard on current-gen platforms. Last-gen support likely dropped, reducing addressable market.

## Per-Title Analysis

### 1. FIFA 23 — 10M copies, $600M revenue (Medium confidence)

**The last FIFA-branded game.** Released Sept 30, 2022; actively sold throughout 2023 until digital delisting.

**Reddit evidence:**
- **10.3M first-week "players"** — EA press release, referenced via comparison in Post 1 (r/pcgaming). Described as "record-breaking" at the time.
- Actual first-week purchasers estimated at ~6M after discounting EA Play/Game Pass/trial users (~40% inflation).
- **Europe's #1 game** through early 2023 — Hogwarts Legacy in Feb 2023 was described as the "fastest-selling non-FIFA game for a generation" (Post 12, r/Games, score 5,086), confirming FIFA's dominance.
- Remained in **US top 5** through May 2023 per Circana data (Post 8, r/gaming, score 15,893).
- Benefited significantly from the 2022 FIFA World Cup (Qatar) in-game mode.
- **Delisted from all digital storefronts September 2023** when the FIFA license expired (Post 7, r/gaming, score 6,162).
- The delisting shortened the digital sales tail but physical copies remained available through retail.

**Estimate rationale:** ~6M first-week purchasers + World Cup-boosted tail sales through 2023 + physical retail until delisting = ~10M lifecycle. This is conservative for a FIFA title (franchise averages ~10M/year historically over 325M+ total).

---

### 2. EA Sports FC 24 — 8M copies, $520M revenue (Medium confidence)

**First game under EA Sports FC branding.** Released Sept 29, 2023.

**Reddit evidence:**
- **11.3M first-week "players"** including EA Play — exceeded FIFA 23's 10.3M record (Post 1, r/pcgaming). However, EA Play had grown significantly, meaning more non-purchasers in the mix.
- Actual first-week purchasers estimated at ~6.5M.
- **#1 selling game in Europe** in September 2023, beating Starfield (Post 6, r/Games, score 105).
- Multiple Reddit comments noted UK physical sales were down ~30% vs FIFA 23, but EA was ~80% digital on console, so physical declines were partly structural (digital shift).
- **Added to PlayStation Plus in May 2024** — only 7 months after launch (extremely early), suggesting EA considered the paid sales lifecycle largely exhausted.
- EA saved ~$400M/year by dropping the FIFA license, improving margins even with slightly lower unit sales.
- Referenced in Fortnite playtime comparison post as one of the biggest console games alongside CoD and GTA 5 (Post 24, r/gaming, score 4,860).

**Estimate rationale:** ~6.5M first-week purchasers, but early PS Plus placement cut tail sales short. Physical sales down 30% partly offset by digital shift. 8M lifecycle is conservative — slightly below FIFA 23 reflecting rebrand transition.

---

### 3. EA Sports FC 25 — 4.5M copies, $315M revenue (Low confidence)

**Catastrophic underperformance.** Released Sept 27, 2024. EA's fiscal crisis game.

**Reddit evidence:**
- **No specific player count or copies sold disclosed by EA** — itself a red flag, as they trumpeted 10.3M and 11.3M for the prior two titles.
- **Broke US launch month revenue record for soccer games** per Circana (Post 5, r/gamernews) — but this is DOLLAR REVENUE, not units. The $70 price point (up from $60) means fewer copies can produce higher revenue. Higher-priced Ultimate editions also inflated revenue.
- **#7 best-selling US game of 2024** per Circana annual chart (Post 9, r/gaming, score 1,478), despite only ~3 months on sale — decent but not dominant.
- **EA slashed fiscal year forecast** citing FC 25 underperformance (Post 2, r/pcgaming, score 1,004 — Jason Schreier report).
- **EA lost $6 billion in market capitalization** (Post 3, r/Games, score 1,957). u/Forestl (score 473): *"Most of this is because of FC doing badly."*
- EA Q3 FY25 revenue fell to **$1.88B from $1.94B** YoY (Post 4, r/Games, score 260).
- **Half-price within ~7 weeks of launch** — unprecedented discounting speed for a FIFA/FC title.
- **Worst user-rated game in franchise history** across Metacritic, Google, and Steam (Post 14, r/EASportsFC, score 626).
- u/BurzyGuerrero (Post 2, score 17): *"People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore"* — both copy sales AND Ultimate Team spending declined.
- Added to Xbox Game Pass via EA Play June 2025.
- The Balatro developer's viral joke about FC 25 microtransactions (Post 25, r/pcgaming, score 24,453) reflected extreme negative public sentiment.

**Estimate rationale:** Per rules: "For titles described as severely underperforming (EA slashing forecasts, losing billions in market value), estimate a substantial decline from prior year — not a marginal one." A ~44% decline from FC 24's 8M → 4.5M copies. The launch revenue "record" was a pricing artifact, not a volume achievement.

---

### 4. EA Sports FC 26 — 4M copies projected lifecycle, $280M revenue (Low confidence)

**Continued franchise erosion.** Released ~Sept 26, 2025. Still in active sales window (~5 months).

**Reddit evidence:**
- **No specific player count or copies sold found on Reddit.**
- Revealed July 2025 (Post 13, r/EASportsFC, score 747).
- **NOT #1 in US for September 2025** — Borderlands 4 took the top spot (Post 20, r/Games, score 461). Historically, FIFA/FC titles dominate their launch month.
- **Lost UK physical launch to Ghost of Yotei** (Post 10, r/gaming, score 1,235). u/pogray (score 818): *"Beating FIFA on sales in the UK is some feat."*
- **Lost European launch sales to Battlefield 6** (Post 11, r/gaming, score 894) — both are EA games. BF6 also outsold CoD BO6.
- Part of Black Friday 2025 discounting — already reduced within ~2 months (Post 26, r/PS5).
- EA acquired by PIF for $55 billion just days after FC 26 launched (Posts 15–18).
- PC input delay issues at launch (Post 22, r/EASportsFC, score 1,058).
- Community sentiment negative but slightly less extreme than FC 25 (Post 28, r/EASportsFC).

**Estimate rationale:** Continued declining trajectory. Lost #1 in US, UK, and Europe at launch — unprecedented for the franchise. Per rules: "For games still in their active sales window, estimate the full lifecycle total but remain conservative." 4M projected lifecycle reflects continued erosion with modest recovery potential from holiday/spring sales.

---

## Franchise Trajectory Summary

| Title | Est. Copies | YoY Change | Key Signal |
|-------|-------------|------------|------------|
| FIFA 23 | 10.0M | Baseline | World Cup boost, last FIFA brand |
| EA FC 24 | 8.0M | −20% | Successful rebrand, early PS Plus |
| EA FC 25 | 4.5M | −44% | EA slashed forecast, $6B market cap loss |
| EA FC 26 | 4.0M | −11% (proj.) | Lost #1 in US, UK, and EU at launch |

The franchise shows a **clear and accelerating decline** from FIFA 23 through FC 26 in terms of unit sales and market dominance. The loss of the FIFA branding coincided with — but did not solely cause — a broader erosion in consumer interest, compounded by declining game quality and Ultimate Team fatigue.

---

## Important: What These Numbers Exclude

- **Ultimate Team (FUT) microtransactions** — EA's primary revenue driver. Live services represented ~73% of EA's total revenue in FY2024.
- **DLC and expansion content**
- **EA Play / Game Pass subscription revenue** attributable to FC titles
- **FIFA Mobile / EA Sports FC Mobile** — free-to-play mobile titles with no copy sales
- **In-app purchases of any kind**

The $1.72B total represents **copy sales revenue only**. The franchise generates substantially more from microtransactions.

## Data Limitations

1. **EA does not disclose per-title unit sales.** All estimates are derived from indirect Reddit-sourced data points.
2. **"Players" ≠ copies sold.** EA's reported metrics include EA Play, Game Pass, PS Plus, and trial users.
3. **UK physical sales** are the most granular publicly available data but represent only ~10–20% of total sales.
4. **FC 26 is still in its active sales window** (~5 months old). The 4M estimate is a conservative projected lifecycle total.
5. **No NPD/Circana or publisher-sourced** individual title unit sales data was found on Reddit for any title.
6. **r/FIFA was inaccessible** — merged/redirected to r/EASportsFC.
7. **All confidence ratings are Low or Medium** due to the fundamental absence of official copies-sold data.
