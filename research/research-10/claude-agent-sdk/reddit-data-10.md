  - u/vKEVUv (score 244): "EA always had big internal expectations so a fact they only forecasted 3 million 'players' during initial sales window for AAA Dragon Age RPG... Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription so while not significant % of people played using EA Play and GFNOW those still make up some chunk of 'players' number."

Like the last 2 releases had the new anticheat that has been buggy as shit, they still are charging the full price even though they haven't added anything of value really in the last few releases and actually if anything they made stuff a bit worse on occasion.

## Per-Game Sales Summary

### FIFA 23 (Released Sept 30, 2022; Active into 2023)

**Copies Sold / Player Data Found on Reddit:**
- **10.3 million players in first week** (EA press release, referenced in Post 1 via comparison)
  - Described as "record-breaking" at the time
  - IMPORTANT: "Players" includes EA Play/Game Pass trial users, NOT just copies purchased
- **Best-selling game in Europe** through early 2023 (Post 12 -- Hogwarts Legacy was "fastest-selling game that isn't FIFA for a generation")
- FIFA 23 was on the **US top 5 best-selling chart through May 2023** (Post 8, Circana data)
- **Delisted from digital stores September 2023** when EA FC 24 launched (Post 7)
- Included a 2022 Qatar World Cup mode that boosted engagement
- No specific lifetime total copy sales figure found on Reddit

**Estimated Total Copies Sold:** Not available on Reddit. EA does not disclose individual title unit sales. Industry context from Reddit discussions suggests FIFA titles typically sell 10-20+ million copies over their lifecycle. The FIFA franchise has sold 325+ million copies across 30+ years.

### EA Sports FC 24 (Released Sept 29, 2023)

**Copies Sold / Player Data Found on Reddit:**
- **11.3 million players in first week** (including EA Play), per EA press release (Post 1)
- This EXCEEDED FIFA 23's first-week record of 10.3 million
- **#1 selling game in Europe** in September 2023, beating Starfield (Post 6)
- FC 24 was given away on PlayStation Plus in May 2024 (~7 months after launch)
- **CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** "Players" includes EA Play/Game Pass/trial users. Actual copies sold would be meaningfully lower than 11.3M first week.
- Reddit commenters noted UK physical sales were down ~30% vs FIFA 23, but EA was ~80% digital on console so physical declines were partly structural
- EA saved ~$400M/year by dropping the FIFA license, so even flat or slightly down unit sales could mean improved profitability

**Estimated Total Copies Sold:** No specific copies sold figure exists on Reddit. EA does not report this metric.

### EA Sports FC 25 (Released Sept 27, 2024)

**Copies Sold / Player Data Found on Reddit:**
- **No specific copies sold or player count figure found on Reddit.**
- **Launch month broke US revenue record for soccer games** (Post 5, Circana data) -- but this is REVENUE not UNITS. Higher $70 price point can produce revenue records with fewer unit sales.
- **#7 best-selling game in the USA for all of 2024** per Circana annual data (Post 9), despite only ~3 months on sale
- **UNDERPERFORMED significantly post-launch:**
  - EA slashed FY forecast due to FC 25 underperformance (Post 2)
  - EA lost $6B in market value (Post 3)
  - EA Q3 FY25 revenue: $1.88B, down from $1.94B YoY (Post 4)
  - Comment from r/PS5 (not numbered here): "FC25 released September 27th and was half price mid-November" -- rapid discounting ~7 weeks post-launch
- **Worst user-rated game in franchise history** across Metacritic, Google, and Steam (Post 14)
- FC 25 joined Xbox Game Pass via EA Play June 2025
- Reddit community universally panned the game (Posts 14, 23, 25)
- Key issue per Reddit: both lower unit sales AND lower Ultimate Team card spending ("People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore")

**Estimated Total Copies Sold:** No specific copies sold figure on Reddit. The contradiction of "broke US launch revenue record" vs "underperformed" is explained by $70 pricing masking lower unit sales, and the real problem being Ultimate Team microtransaction decline after launch.

### EA Sports FC 26 (Released ~Sept 26, 2025)

**Copies Sold / Player Data Found on Reddit:**
- **No specific copies sold or player count figure found on Reddit.**
- Revealed July 2025 (Post 13), launched September 2025
- **NOT #1 in US for September 2025** -- Borderlands 4 took that spot (Post 20)
- **Lost to Ghost of Yotei in UK physical sales** (Post 10) -- very unusual for FIFA/FC
- **Lost to Battlefield 6 in European launch sales** (Post 11) -- both are EA games
- Part of Black Friday 2025 sales discussion, indicating it was being discounted early
- **EA sold for $55 billion** just days after FC 26's launch (Posts 15-18)
- Had PC input delay issues at launch (Post 22)
- Community sentiment negative but less extreme than FC 25 (Post 28)

**Estimated Total Copies Sold:** No specific copies sold figure on Reddit. FC 26 is still relatively new (~5 months at time of research). Launch signals suggest it may have continued the declining trajectory of FC 25, given losses to competitors in UK physical and European launch sales.

## Important Context: "Players" vs "Copies Sold"

EA deliberately uses "players" rather than "copies sold" in its communications. Multiple Reddit users called this out:

- u/vKEVUv (Post 2, score 244): "Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription..."
- u/TemporalAntiAssening (Post 1, score 5): "More people downloaded the trial through game pass. Whether that translates into sales is yet to be seen."

**"Players" includes:** People who purchased the game, EA Play subscribers, PS Plus recipients, Game Pass users, free trial users, GeForce Now subscribers.

**Actual copies sold figures are NEVER reported by EA** for individual FIFA/FC titles. No specific copies sold numbers exist on Reddit for any title in this period.

---

## Data Limitations

1. **EA does NOT report copies sold** for individual FIFA/FC titles. They report "players" and "net bookings" which conflate copy sales with subscription access and live service revenue.
2. **No VGChartz, NPD/Circana, or publisher-sourced** individual title unit sales data for FIFA 23, FC 24, FC 25, or FC 26 was found on Reddit.
3. **Reddit is a secondary source.** Most sales data on Reddit comes from articles (VGC, Hollywood Reporter, GamesIndustry.biz, PushSquare, etc.) or EA earnings calls.
4. **r/FIFA was inaccessible** -- merged/redirected to r/EASportsFC.
5. **Physical sales data** (the most granular publicly available data) represents only ~10-20% of total sales.
6. **FC 26 is very recent** (launched Sept 2025, ~5 months ago) and comprehensive lifecycle sales data is not yet available.
