  - u/Gaudious (score 74): "So give or take EA Mathematically made more this year than with FIFA last year. Because they're paying less licensing deals, making those deals with the clubs, leagues and players directly"

- **Top Comments:**
  - u/irJess (score 227): "I work at Tesco, we have actually stopped physical game sales in the last year. I'm sure the name change does contribute but I do believe a large amount would have bought digital this year."
  - u/mocoworm (score 199): "But what are the overall sales? I would expect physical to be down YoY as that media is declining. Are the total sales figures down by 30%, or was there a 30% increase in digital?"
  - u/NotFromMilkyWay (score 6): "Just for numbers sake: EA is 80% digital across console platforms according to their financial reports. Digital growth is around 5 percentage points per year. So if last year they sold 20% of FIFA physically that means they sold 15% this year. Just from that effect alone it would be expected for physical sales to be 25% less than last year. It's at 30% instead. So it sells pretty well. I doubt 5% of physical copies equal the 400 million per year FIFA demanded."
  - u/Bashemgud33 (score 42): "Most people have no idea the it's the same game but the name changed because the FIFA deal fell through."

- **Key Sales Data:** EA slashed its fiscal year forecast. Both EA Sports FC 25 AND Dragon Age: The Veilguard named as underperforming "holiday games." Dragon Age reached ~1.5M players (missed expectations by ~50%). FC 25 underperformance also cited but no specific player/sales figure given for FC 25.
- **Top Comments:**
  - u/BurzyGuerrero (score 17): "EA FC25 underperforming is way more of an issue for EA then dragon age. People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore."
  - u/vKEVUv (score 244): "EA always had big internal expectations so a fact they only forecasted 3 million 'players' during initial sales window for AAA Dragon Age RPG... Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription so while not significant % of people played using EA Play and GFNOW those still make up some chunk of 'players' number."
  - u/DMercenary (score 17): "FC25: does that mean they'll actually start to innovate instead of copy pasting last year's?"

  - u/Forestl (score 475): "Most of this is because of FC doing badly. They've made a shit ton of money from that game and it has helped them through other flops. To see those numbers going down is very bad"
  - u/FlukyS (score 189): "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual. Like the last 2 releases had the new anticheat that has been buggy as shit, they still are charging the full price even though they haven't added anything of value really in the last few releases and actually if anything they made stuff a bit worse on occasion. There really isn't any reason to buy their game and I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm excited to see what 2k do with the FIFA license."

- **Key Sales Data:** FC 25's launch month broke the revenue record for soccer games in the US (Circana). However, this is REVENUE not UNITS -- higher price points ($70 standard, $100 ultimate editions) can produce revenue records with fewer unit sales. The subsequent underperformance (Posts 3-6) shows the initial strong launch did not sustain.

## Per-Game Sales Summary

### FIFA 23 (Released Sept 30, 2022; Active into 2023)

**Copies Sold / Player Data Found on Reddit:**
- No specific total copies sold figure was found on Reddit for FIFA 23.
- From Post 2: EA Sports FC 24 UK physical sales were DOWN 30% vs FIFA 23, meaning FIFA 23 set a high physical sales benchmark.
- FIFA 23 had a reported 10.3 million players in its first week (referenced in an EA press release discussed in a r/pcgaming post about FC 24 comparative performance -- post ID 173ttp3, which appeared in the earlier iteration's research but was confirmed in multiple comment threads).
- FIFA 23 included a 2022 Qatar World Cup mode that boosted player counts.
- FIFA 23 was delisted from digital storefronts September 2023 (Post 16).
- FIFA games have historically been Europe's fastest-selling games (contextual from Post referencing "biggest non-FIFA or Call of Duty launch" framing).

**Estimated Total Copies Sold:** Not available on Reddit. EA does not disclose individual title unit sales. Industry context from Reddit discussions suggests FIFA titles typically sell in the range of 10-20+ million copies over their lifecycle.

### EA Sports FC 24 (Released Sept 29, 2023)

**Copies Sold / Player Data Found on Reddit:**
- **14.5 million "players" in first month** (Post 1)
- **11.3 million players in first week** (including EA Play), per EA press release referenced in multiple Reddit threads
- This EXCEEDED FIFA 23's first-week player count of 10.3 million
- UK physical sales were down 30% compared to FIFA 23 (Post 2), but commenters noted this was largely due to physical-to-digital shift
- EA is ~80% digital on console (Post 2 comment)
- FC 24 was the #1 best-selling game in Germany for 2024 (found in earlier iteration research, confirmed in search results)
- FC 24 was given away on PlayStation Plus in May 2024 (Post 17) -- ~7 months after launch
- EA reported "double-digit growth in new players and FUT revenue up high-single digits YoY through first four weeks" in November 2023 earnings call (referenced in Reddit comments)
- The FIFA license reportedly cost EA ~$400M/year, so even if sales were slightly down, profitability could have improved (Post 2 comment)

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** "Players" includes EA Play/Game Pass/trial users. Actual copies sold would be lower than 14.5M. No specific copies sold figure exists on Reddit.

## Important Context: "Players" vs "Copies Sold"

EA deliberately uses "players" rather than "copies sold" in its communications. Multiple Reddit users called this out:

- u/vKEVUv (Post 3, score 244): "Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription..."
- u/NotFromMilkyWay (Post 2, score 6): "EA is 80% digital across console platforms according to their financial reports."

**"Players" includes:** People who purchased the game, EA Play subscribers, PS Plus recipients, Game Pass users, free trial users, GeForce Now subscribers.

**Actual copies sold figures are NEVER reported by EA** for individual FIFA/FC titles. No specific copies sold numbers exist on Reddit for any title in this period.

## Data Limitations

1. **EA does NOT report copies sold** for individual FIFA/FC titles. They report "players" and "net bookings" which conflate copy sales with subscription access and live service revenue.
2. **No VGChartz, NPD/Circana, or publisher-sourced** individual title unit sales data for FIFA 23, FC 24, FC 25, or FC 26 was found on Reddit.
3. **Reddit is a secondary source.** Most sales data on Reddit comes from articles (VGC, Hollywood Reporter, GamesIndustry.biz, PushSquare, etc.) or EA earnings calls.
4. **r/FIFA was inaccessible** -- merged/redirected to r/EASportsFC.
5. **Physical sales data** (the most granular publicly available data) represents only ~10-20% of total sales.
6. **FC 26 is very recent** (launched Sept 2025, ~5 months ago) and comprehensive lifecycle sales data is not yet available.
