## Per-Game Sales Summary

### FIFA 23 (2023 — last game under FIFA name)
- **Copies Sold:** ~10.3 million (estimated based on historical FIFA franchise data — FIFA 22 sold ~10 million, and FIFA 23 was the final FIFA-branded game with increased interest)
- **Sources:** No specific Reddit post citing exact FIFA 23 sales figures found. The EA financial reporting posts reference overall franchise performance but not specific unit sales for FIFA 23. Historical context: FIFA games have consistently sold 10+ million copies annually.
- **Confidence:** Medium — based on franchise historical patterns and the "last FIFA" branding boost

### EA Sports FC 24 (September 2023)
- **Copies Sold:** ~8-9 million (estimated)
- **Sources:** No specific Reddit post with exact FC 24 unit sales. However, the fact that FC 24 was already 50% off within 6 weeks of launch (Post 4) suggests initial sales were below expectations. EA's financial reports referenced in Posts 7-9 indicate the FC franchise began underperforming during this period. The rebranding from FIFA to EA FC likely contributed to some sales loss.
- **Confidence:** Medium — based on early discount patterns and EA financial commentary

### EA Sports FC 25 (September 2024)
- **Copies Sold:** ~5-6 million (estimated, significant decline)
- **Sources:** Multiple Reddit posts document FC 25's severe underperformance:
  - EA slashed fiscal year forecasts specifically citing FC 25 (Post 7)
  - EA lost $6 billion in market value due to FC 25 underperformance (Post 8)
  - EA revenue fell to $1.88B from $1.94B, with FC weakness cited (Post 9)
  - Worst user ratings in franchise history (Post 6)
  - Added to Game Pass by June 2025, indicating end-of-life (Post 10)
- **Confidence:** Medium — significant underperformance well-documented but exact unit count not disclosed on Reddit

### EA Sports FC 26 (September/October 2025)
- **Copies Sold:** ~6-7 million (estimated based on partial data)
- **Sources:**
  - Ghost of Yotei beat FC 26 in UK physical sales (Post 12), though physical sales are ~10% of total
  - Battlefield 6 beat FC 26 in European premium launch sales (Post 13)
  - FC 26 still likely sold millions given the franchise's massive global footprint, especially in markets like South America, Middle East, and Asia
  - EA Q2 showed 13% revenue decline (Post 14), though this was partly attributed to College Football 25 comparative period
- **Confidence:** Low — FC 26 launched recently and full sales data is limited; being outsold by other titles in key markets is concerning
