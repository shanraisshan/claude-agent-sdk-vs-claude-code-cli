## Methodology & Reasoning

### FIFA 23 (~13.5M copies, $60 avg retail)
- **Release:** September 30, 2022. Active through September 2023 (servers shut down Sept 2023).
- **World Cup boost applied:** FIFA 23 coincided with the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup (Nov-Dec 2022). Per franchise baseline of ~10.8M average annual copies for modern FIFA titles, a 20-25% World Cup boost yields ~13-14M copies. Used 13.5M (midpoint).
- **Supporting Reddit evidence:**
  - "Hogwarts Legacy is Europe's fastest-selling game (that isn't FIFA) for a generation" (r/Games, 5,079 upvotes, March 2023) -- FIFA 23 explicitly excluded from comparisons because it was so dominant in European sales.
  - FIFA 23's World Cup mode was heavily discussed (r/EASportsFC, 2,535 upvotes, Nov 2022), confirming the World Cup tie-in drove massive engagement.
  - EA reported ~10.3M first-week "players" (cited in broader gaming discourse on Reddit). However, first-week "players" includes trial users and is not equivalent to lifetime copies.
- **Price:** $60 (released before 2023, when $60 was the standard price point).
- **Revenue:** 13.5M x $60 = $810M.
- **Confidence:** Medium -- World Cup boost is well-established for FIFA titles, and FIFA 23 was consistently referenced as the dominant European game. Exact copy count is estimated from franchise averages + World Cup multiplier.

### EA Sports FC 24 (~11.0M copies, $70 avg retail)
- **Release:** September 29, 2023. First game under the EA Sports FC branding.
- **Player-to-copies conversion:** EA reported ~14.5M first-week "players" (referenced in gaming media discussions on Reddit). Applying the 75-80% conversion (EA "players" includes EA Play, Game Pass, trial users): 14.5M x 0.76 = ~11.0M copies. This represents the full lifecycle estimate -- no additional lifecycle bump applied.
- **Supporting Reddit evidence:**
  - EA pulled all old FIFA games from Steam when FC 24 launched (r/gaming, 6,154 upvotes, Sept 2023), forcing the brand transition.
  - "Fortnite playtime on consoles was greater than Call of Duty, EA Sports FC, GTA 5 and Roblox combined" (r/gaming, 4,869 upvotes, Jan 2024) -- FC 24 was still significant enough to be named alongside the biggest franchises.
  - Multiple Reddit users noted buying habits: u/froggyjm9 "had bought every FIFA game since 1998, but didn't buy EA FC 24 and 25" -- anecdotal evidence of some attrition after rebrand.
  - Despite rebrand concerns, EA's player count was UP from FIFA 23 (14.5M vs 10.3M first-week), suggesting the franchise maintained momentum.
- **Price:** $70 (2023+ title, PS5/Xbox Series X primary SKU at $70).
- **Revenue:** 11.0M x $70 = $770M.
- **Confidence:** Medium -- The 14.5M player figure is well-referenced; the 76% conversion is an informed estimate based on EA Play/Game Pass subscriber overlap patterns.

### EA Sports FC 25 (~8.0M copies, $70 avg retail)
- **Release:** September 27, 2024. Confirmed commercial underperformer.
- **Underperformance rule applied:** FC 25 met ALL underperformance criteria:
  - EA slashed fiscal year guidance (~$500M+ cut) specifically citing FC 25 (r/pcgaming, 1,005 upvotes, Jan 2025).
  - EA lost $6B+ in market value (r/Games, 1,949 upvotes, Jan 2025).
  - Added to Xbox Game Pass in June 2025 (r/Games, 262 upvotes) -- indicating premium sales had declined enough to pivot to subscription revenue.
  - Worst user-rated game in franchise history on Metacritic, Google, and Steam (r/EASportsFC, 626 upvotes).
  - EA Q3 FY25 revenue fell from $1.94B to $1.88B year-over-year, with FC 25 cited as a primary driver (r/Games, 259 upvotes, Feb 2025).
- **Calculation:** Prior year (FC 24) sold ~11.0M copies. Underperformance rule: 70-73% of prior year = 7.7M-8.0M. Used 8.0M.
- **Price:** $70.
- **Revenue:** 8.0M x $70 = $560M.
- **Confidence:** Medium -- The severity of EA's response ($6B market cap loss, fiscal year guidance cut) firmly establishes this as a major underperformance, making the 70-73% estimate well-grounded.

### EA Sports FC 26 (~8.5M copies projected, $70 avg retail)
- **Release:** September 2025 (~September 18-19, 2025). Still in active sales window (~5 months at time of analysis).
- **Full lifecycle projection applied:** As the game is <6 months old, this estimates the full annual lifecycle total, not just copies sold to date.
- **Assessment: Continued weakness, not recovery.** Despite launching after the FC 25 disaster, FC 26 shows NO clear recovery signals:
  - Outsold by Ghost of Yotei in UK physical sales (r/gaming, 1,238 upvotes; r/PS5, 653 upvotes, Oct 2025) -- "Beating FIFA on sales in the UK is some feat."
  - Outsold by Battlefield 6 across Europe at launch (r/gaming, 892 upvotes, Oct 2025) -- historically unprecedented; BF has never outsold FIFA/FC at European launch.
  - Borderlands 4 (not FC 26) was the top-selling game of September 2025 per Circana US data (r/Games, 456 upvotes).
  - Discounted 50% within ~3 months at Black Friday (r/Games, 222 upvotes, Dec 2025).
  - Called "worst football game of all FIFA series" by community (r/EASportsFC, 136 upvotes).
  - PC input delay mega-thread at launch (r/EASportsFC, 724 upvotes) -- technical issues plagued the launch.
- **Mitigating factor:** FC 26 still topped European Black Friday charts at the discounted price, suggesting the franchise retains mass-market appeal when aggressively priced.
- **No EA guidance cut reported for FC 26** (unlike FC 25), which may indicate it performed slightly above the FC 25 nadir.
- **Estimate:** ~8.5M for the full lifecycle, representing roughly flat performance vs FC 25 (~6% above), accounting for the Black Friday volume bump offset by the historically weak launch.
- **Price:** $70.
- **Revenue:** 8.5M x $70 = $595M.
- **Confidence:** Low -- Game is still in its active sales window. Launch signals are negative, but Black Friday performance and lack of EA guidance cuts provide some upside.

## Key Context from Reddit

1. **FIFA dominance in Europe:** FIFA/FC is explicitly acknowledged as THE perennial European sales champion. Hogwarts Legacy was marketed as "Europe's fastest-selling game that isn't FIFA" (r/Games, 5,079 upvotes).

2. **"Players" vs "Copies Sold":** EA consistently reports "players" rather than copies sold. Multiple Reddit users flagged this: u/vKEVUv called it "corny" noting EA Play and GeForce Now subscribers inflate the count. Actual purchasers are ~75-80% of reported player counts.

3. **Franchise decline narrative (2023-2025):**
   - FIFA 23 (2022-23): Peak — World Cup boost + "last ever FIFA" marketing
   - FC 24 (2023-24): Solid transition — player counts up despite rebrand
   - FC 25 (2024-25): Confirmed crash — $6B market value loss, worst ratings ever
   - FC 26 (2025-26): Continued weakness — outsold by multiple competitors, aggressive discounting

4. **College Football surpassed FIFA:** EA Sports College Football 25 became the all-time best-selling sports video game in US history by dollar sales (r/Games, Dec 2024), surpassing any FIFA/FC title.

5. **EA acquisition for $55B:** EA was acquired by PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners for $55 billion (r/gaming, 3,315 upvotes; r/Games, 2,637 upvotes, Sept 2025). 99% of shareholders voted in favor (r/Games, Dec 2025). The FIFA/FC franchise's microtransaction revenue was a core driver of EA's valuation.

## Data Limitations

1. **EA does not publicly report specific copy sales for individual FIFA/FC titles.** They report "players" (which includes EA Play/subscription users) and aggregate revenue in quarterly earnings.
2. **Reddit is a secondary source** -- most sales figures discussed on Reddit reference external sources (Circana/NPD, GSD/GfK European data, EA earnings calls, journalist reports like Jason Schreier).
3. **Physical sales data** (UK boxed charts, GSD premium data) is frequently discussed on Reddit but represents only ~10-15% of the total market. Digital sales (85-90%) are less visible.
4. **All copy estimates are derived from indirect signals:** player count conversions, underperformance severity indicators, and relative competitive performance -- not from direct EA disclosures of unit sales.
5. **FC 26 is still in its active sales window** (~5 months old). The 8.5M projection assumes the full annual lifecycle but carries significant uncertainty.
