## Methodology & Reasoning

### FIFA 23 (~13.5M copies, $60 avg retail)
- **Release:** September 30, 2022. Active through September 2023. Last game with FIFA branding.
- **EA reported:** 10.3 million players in the first week — the "largest launch period in EA SPORTS FIFA franchise history" (EA investor relations press release, posted on r/XboxSeriesX post y242vz, score 84).
- **World Cup boost applied:** FIFA 23 coincided with the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar (Nov–Dec 2022). Per franchise analysis, World Cup-year titles sell 20–25% above the typical annual franchise baseline of ~10.8M copies. This yields ~13–14M copies. Estimate: **13.5M** (midpoint).
- **Supporting Reddit evidence:**
  - FIFA 23 had 10.3M first-week players, described as "largest launch in EA Sports FIFA franchise history" (r/XboxSeriesX).
  - Comment noted "Having a World Cup in November presumably feeds into this" (score 18).
  - Elden Ring was described as "the biggest non-FIFA or Call of Duty launch since Red Dead Redemption 2" (r/Games, score 13,915) — confirming FIFA's position as the benchmark for UK/European game launches.
  - FIFA 23 dominated European sales charts — it was the implicit standard other games were measured against.
- **Price:** $60 (released Sept 2022, before the $70 pricing standard for 2023+ titles).
- **Revenue:** 13.5M × $60 = **$810M**.
- **Confidence:** Medium — EA's official first-week player count anchors the estimate; World Cup boost is well-documented historically; lifetime figure extrapolated from franchise patterns.

### EA Sports FC 24 (~11.0M copies, $70 avg retail)
- **Release:** September 29, 2023. First game under the EA Sports FC branding.
- **Player-to-copies conversion:** EA reported ~14.5M players in the first month (widely cited in gaming media; referenced as context in Reddit raw data). FC 24 was #1 in European sales in September 2023, beating Starfield (r/XboxSeriesX post 17bilxa, score 9). Among top console games by playtime in late 2023 alongside CoD, GTA 5, and Roblox (r/gaming post 197cami, score 4,864).
- **Conversion calculation:** EA "players" counts include EA Play subscribers, Game Pass trial users, and free trial participants. Actual purchasers are typically 75–80% of reported player counts. 14.5M × 0.76 ≈ **11.0M copies**. This represents the full lifecycle estimate — no additional lifecycle bump applied.
- **Supporting Reddit evidence:**
  - EA pulled all old FIFA games from storefronts when FC 24 launched (r/gaming post 16to3kb, score 6,161), forcing the brand transition.
  - FC 24 was significant enough to be named alongside CoD, GTA 5, and Roblox in engagement comparisons (r/gaming).
  - Successful brand transition confirmed by strong European chart performance.
- **Price:** $70 (2023+ title, PS5/Xbox Series X primary SKU at $70).
- **Revenue:** 11.0M × $70 = **$770M**.
- **Confidence:** Medium — The 14.5M player figure is well-referenced; the 76% conversion is an informed estimate based on EA Play/Game Pass subscriber overlap patterns; strong chart performance corroborates.

### EA Sports FC 25 (~8.0M copies, $70 avg retail)
- **Release:** September 27, 2024. Confirmed severe commercial underperformer.
- **Underperformance rule applied:** FC 25 met ALL underperformance criteria:
  - EA slashed fiscal year forecast (~$500M+ cut) specifically citing FC 25 (r/pcgaming post 1i7m0ck, score 1,009; r/PS5 post 1i7m1am, score 1,503 — January 2025).
  - EA lost $6B+ in market value (r/Games post 1i8x6am, score 1,954 — January 2025).
  - Game was half-price by mid-November 2024, just ~7 weeks after launch (comment by u/Santino_18 in r/PS5 post, score 354).
  - Worst user-rated game in franchise history on Metacritic, Google, and Steam (r/EASportsFC).
  - EA Q3 FY25 revenue fell from $1.94B to $1.88B year-over-year, with FC 25 cited as a primary driver (r/Games post 1ihva33, score 262).
  - Comment: "EAFC deserves to have flopped" (r/Games, score 190); "Most of this is because of FC doing badly" (r/Games, score 473).
- **Calculation:** Prior year (FC 24) sold ~11.0M copies. Underperformance rule: 70–73% of prior year = 7.7M–8.0M. Estimate: **8.0M copies**.
- **Price:** $70.
- **Revenue:** 8.0M × $70 = **$560M**.
- **Confidence:** Medium — The severity of EA's response ($6B market cap loss, fiscal year guidance cut, half-price in 7 weeks) firmly establishes this as a 20–30% decline in unit sales vs. FC 24.

### EA Sports FC 26 (~9.5M copies projected, $70 avg retail)
- **Release:** September 2025 (early access ~Sept 12; full launch ~Sept 19–26, 2025). Still in active sales window (~5 months at time of analysis).
- **Full lifecycle projection applied:** As the game is <6 months old, this estimates the full annual lifecycle total. Annual sports franchises sell ~85–90% of lifetime copies in the first 12 months.
- **Launch indicators (mixed signals):**
  - **NEGATIVE:** Ghost of Yotei beat FC 26 in UK physical sales during FC 26's second week — unprecedented for the franchise (r/gaming post 1nzc677, score 1,242; r/PS5 post 1nyu1z1, score 663). Comment: "Beating FIFA on sales in the UK is some feat" (score 812).
  - **NEGATIVE:** Battlefield 6 outsold FC 26 at European launch in premium sales — historically unprecedented (r/gaming post 1o9atzm, score 894).
  - **NEGATIVE:** Borderlands 4, not FC 26, was the best-selling game of September 2025 in the US per Circana data (r/Games post 1od7v2m, score 459).
  - **NEGATIVE:** FC 26 was not among Steam's top-tier sellers for 2025 (r/Games post 1pytm5s, score 2,457).
  - **NEGATIVE:** Game was 50% off within ~3 months (Black Friday discounting).
  - **NEGATIVE:** Server routing issues at launch (r/EASportsFC post 1nt7qyg, score 165).
- **Recovery signals:**
  - **POSITIVE:** Community reception of gameplay direction was more positive than FC 25 ("Everything in this sounds super positive. Really happy with the game's direction" — r/EASportsFC launch update post 1nf7hhi, score 172).
  - **POSITIVE:** Active competitive community as of late 2025 (r/EASportsFC post 1paowd4, score 636 — "352 Guide from an Elite 1 Player").
  - **POSITIVE:** No EA guidance cut reported for FC 26 (unlike FC 25's $500M+ cut), suggesting it met or slightly exceeded lowered expectations.
  - **CONTEXT:** September 2025 had unusually fierce competition (Borderlands 4, Ghost of Yotei, Battlefield 6 all launching nearby).
- **Projection:** FC 26 shows "slight recovery" in community sentiment and no financial panic from EA, qualifying as a modest improvement over the severely underperforming FC 25. Per the recovery rule: 15–20% above FC 25's 8.0M = 9.2M–9.6M. Estimate: **9.5M copies (projected full lifecycle)**.
- **Price:** $70 (2025 title, current-gen standard).
- **Revenue:** 9.5M × $70 = **$665M**.
- **Confidence:** Low — Game is still in its active sales window; projection based on franchise trends and mixed early signals; the unusually competitive September 2025 market and rapid discounting inject uncertainty.

## Key Context from Reddit

1. **FIFA dominance in Europe:** FIFA/FC is THE perennial European sales champion. Elden Ring was described as "the biggest non-FIFA or Call of Duty launch since Red Dead Redemption 2" (r/Games, 13,915 upvotes), and other games are measured against the FIFA benchmark.

2. **"Players" vs "Copies Sold":** EA consistently reports "players" rather than copies sold. Reddit users frequently flag this: u/vKEVUv called it "corny" noting EA Play and GeForce Now subscribers inflate the count (r/pcgaming, score 243). Actual purchasers are ~75–80% of reported player counts.

3. **Franchise decline trajectory (2022–2025):**
   - FIFA 23 (2022–23): Peak — World Cup boost + "last ever FIFA" marketing + record launch
   - FC 24 (2023–24): Solid transition — strong player counts despite rebrand, #1 Europe
   - FC 25 (2024–25): Severe crash — $6B market value loss, worst user ratings, half-price in 7 weeks
   - FC 26 (2025–26): Modest community recovery but continued weak sales metrics

4. **EA acquisition for $55B:** EA was acquired by PIF/Silver Lake/Affinity Partners for $55 billion in September 2025 (r/Games post 1ntgc9s, score 2,643; r/EASportsFC post 1ntgp6o, score 462). 99% of shareholders voted in favor (r/Games post 1pwyoi1, score 1,137). Community attributed valuation primarily to FUT microtransaction revenue.

5. **Revenue scope reminder:** This report covers **copy sales only** (physical + digital). FUT microtransactions, DLC, EA Play subscriptions, and in-app purchases are excluded. FUT likely generates **more revenue** than copy sales for these titles.

## Data Limitations

1. **EA does not publicly report specific copy sales for individual FIFA/FC titles.** They report "players" (which includes EA Play/subscription users) and aggregate revenue in quarterly earnings.
2. **Reddit is a secondary source** — most sales figures discussed on Reddit reference external sources (Circana/NPD, GSD/GfK European data, EA earnings calls, journalist reports like Jason Schreier).
3. **Physical sales data** (UK boxed charts, GSD premium data) is frequently discussed on Reddit but represents only ~10–15% of the total market. Digital sales (85–90%) are less visible.
4. **All copy estimates are derived from indirect signals:** player count conversions, underperformance severity indicators, and relative competitive performance — not from direct EA disclosures of unit sales.
5. **FC 26 is still in its active sales window** (~5 months old). The 9.5M projection assumes the full annual lifecycle but carries significant uncertainty.
