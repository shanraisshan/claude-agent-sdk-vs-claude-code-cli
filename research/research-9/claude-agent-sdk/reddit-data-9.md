- **Key Content:** Jason Schreier reported EA slashing fiscal year forecast. Dragon Age: Veilguard reached ~1.5 million players, missing expectations by nearly 50% (expected 3 million). EA Sports FC 25 also underperformed.
- **Key Comments:**
  - u/vKEVUv (score: 246): "EA always had big internal expectations so a fact they only forecasted 3 million 'players' during initial sales window for AAA Dragon Age RPG... Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription so while not significant % of people played using EA Play and GFNOW those still make up some chunk of 'players'"
  - u/BurzyGuerrero (score: 17): "EA FC25 underperforming is way more of an issue for EA then dragon age. People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore."

- **Key Comments:**
  - u/Forestl (score: 476): "Most of this is because of FC doing badly. They've made a shit ton of money from that game and it has helped them through other flops. To see those numbers going down is very bad"
  - u/FlukyS (score: 191): "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual. Like the last 2 releases had the new anticheat that has been buggy as shit, they still are charging the full price even though they haven't added anything of value really in the last few releases and actually if anything they made stuff a bit worse on occasion."
  - u/orze (score: 161): "Surprise the FIFA game is doing badly, don't know if it's the name change or FINALLY people got tired of it?"
  - u/froggyjm9 (score: 77): "I had bought every fifa game since 1998, but didn't buy EA FC 24 and 25... all of my friends are too busy and we can't play it anymore, plus with getting older there's a huge disconnect between the era of players I grew up with."

- **Key Comments:**
  - u/Xenobrina (score: 369): "Honestly really glad to see EA Sports FC in the headline unlike every other article that tries to pin it solely on Veilgaurd. EA sports losing money is a much more notable story anyway."
  - u/BatPixi (score: 43): "Considering they are saving money on the fifa license this revenue could actually be positive for them."
  - u/Villag3Idiot (score: 16): "Are people finally tired of EA's annual sports game rehash or is there some other reason?"

  - u/pogray (score: 811): "Beating Fifa on sales in the UK is some feat"
  - u/DodgerCyclops (score: 283): "This is pointless, physical sales are tiny now so using this as any sort of metric is a waste there's no point counting it [Almost 90% of games sold in UK in 2022 were digital - ERA]"
  - u/baddude1337 (score: 26): "Physical only, be more interested to see total sales. Still, even for physical beating EAFC is quite impressive. I expect a lot of the casual sports only gamers still buy physical."

- **Key Comments:**
  - u/SamShakusky71 (score: 242): [quoting article] "There are a few caveats. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was included in Xbox Game Pass, which means it's likely Call of Duty had a far higher player count than Battlefield 6. This GSD data is purely premium sales."

## Post 10: "Hogwarts Legacy is Europe's fastest-selling game (that isn't FIFA) for a generation"
- **ID:** 11ky1mc
- **Subreddit:** r/Games

- **Date:** March 2023
- **URL:** https://www.gamesindustry.biz/hogwarts-legacy-is-europes-fastest-selling-game-that-isnt-fifa-for-a-generation-european-monthly-charts
- **Key Context:** FIFA is explicitly called out as THE perennial European sales champion. The headline itself acknowledges that FIFA (which would have been FIFA 23 at this time) is so dominant in Europe that other games must be compared "excluding FIFA." This strongly implies FIFA 23 was the top-selling game in Europe during early 2023.

- **Key Content from OP:** References "almost 2 billion in revenue" linking to EA's Q3 FY25 results at https://www.ea.com/news/electronic-arts-reports-q3-fy25-results -- This is a CRITICAL data point: EA generated approximately $2 billion in revenue in a single quarter, with FC being a major contributor.

# SECTION 3: PER-GAME SUMMARY

## Game 1: FIFA 23
- **Release Date:** September 30, 2022
- **Developer/Publisher:** EA Sports / Electronic Arts
- **Platforms:** PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch (Legacy Edition)
- **Status:** Last game under the FIFA branding. Active through 2023. Servers shut down September 2023.
- **World Cup Tie-in:** Featured 2022 FIFA World Cup mode (Qatar World Cup, Nov-Dec 2022), which boosted sales significantly.

### Sales Data Found on Reddit:
- **No specific copy sales figures found directly on Reddit for FIFA 23.**
- **Indirect evidence from Reddit discussions:**
  - The March 2023 post "Hogwarts Legacy is Europe's fastest-selling game (that isn't FIFA) for a generation" (r/Games, 5079 upvotes) explicitly exempts FIFA from the comparison, strongly implying FIFA 23 was the #1 selling game in Europe during this period.
  - FIFA 23 benefited enormously from the 2022 World Cup (November-December 2022), which historically causes massive sales spikes for the FIFA franchise.
  - FIFA has historically been the best-selling game in Europe nearly every year for over a decade.
  - The "Best Selling Video Game Franchises Ever" post (r/gaming, Dec 2025) tracks FIFA as one of the all-time best-selling franchises.

### Context on Commercial Performance:
- FIFA 23 was widely considered a commercial success, boosted by the World Cup
- It was the final FIFA-branded game, generating significant "last ever FIFA" marketing buzz
- EA reported strong performance for FIFA 23 in their earnings calls
- **Note:** EA typically reports "players" rather than "copies sold" -- the distinction matters because players includes EA Play/subscription access, not just purchased copies

### Estimated Sales (based on known data outside Reddit):
- EA reported FIFA 23 had over 10.3 million players in its first week (from EA press releases discussed in gaming media)
- Lifetime sales estimated at 20-25 million copies based on franchise trajectory and World Cup boost
- **These specific figures were NOT found on Reddit posts directly but are referenced in the broader gaming discourse that Reddit users cite**

---

## Game 2: EA Sports FC 24
- **Release Date:** September 29, 2023
- **Developer/Publisher:** EA Sports / Electronic Arts
- **Platforms:** PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch (Legacy Edition)
- **Status:** First game under the EA Sports FC branding after dropping the FIFA license. Active through 2024.

### Sales Data Found on Reddit:
- **No specific copy sales or player count figures found directly on Reddit for FC 24.**
- **Indirect evidence from Reddit discussions:**
  - The EA acquisition post (r/EASportsFC, Sept 2025) context: EA valued at $55 billion partly due to FC/FIFA franchise revenue
  - u/FlukyS in the "EA lost $6 billion" thread noted "the last 2 releases had the new anticheat that has been buggy as shit" -- referring to FC 24 and FC 25
  - u/froggyjm9 stated "I had bought every fifa game since 1998, but didn't buy EA FC 24 and 25" -- anecdotal evidence of player attrition after rebrand
  - "Fortnite playtime on consoles was greater than Call of Duty, EA Sports FC, GTA 5 and Roblox combined" (Jan 2024) -- EA Sports FC (FC 24 at that time) still significant enough to be called out by name in engagement comparisons
  - EA pulled all old FIFA games from Steam when FC 24 launched (Sept 2023 post, r/gaming, 6154 upvotes) -- suggesting EA wanted to force migration to the FC brand

### Context on Commercial Performance:
- FC 24 was the transitional title -- first without the FIFA name
- There were widespread concerns about whether the rebrand would hurt sales
- EA reportedly said FC 24 attracted 14.5 million players in its first week (from EA press releases, cited in gaming media discussions but not found as dedicated Reddit posts)
- The name change was a significant talking point across gaming subreddits
- College Football 25 (released July 2024) eventually surpassed the FIFA/FC franchise as the best-selling sports game in US history by dollar sales (Circana data, r/Games, Dec 2024)

### Estimated Sales (based on known data outside Reddit):
- EA reported FC 24 had 14.5 million players in first week, up from FIFA 23's 10.3 million
- However, "players" includes EA Play subscribers, not just purchasers
- Lifetime copy sales estimated at 15-20 million based on franchise trajectory

- FC 25 weakness was cited as a primary driver of the decline

**KEY POST 4 -- Worst User Ratings (Sept 2025):**
- Post: "FC 25 Is the Worst User-Rated Game in Franchise History Across Several Major Review Sites" (r/EASportsFC, score: 626)
- FC 25 holds the worst user ratings in the entire FIFA/FC franchise history across Metacritic, Google, and Steam

**KEY POST 5 -- Added to Game Pass (June 2025):**
- Post: "Coming to Game Pass: EA Sports FC 25, The Alters, FBC: Firebreak, and More" (r/Games, score: 262)
- FC 25 was added to Xbox Game Pass in June 2025, likely a sign that premium sales had declined enough to make subscription revenue more attractive

### Context on Commercial Performance:
- FC 25 was a CONFIRMED commercial disappointment
- EA cut its fiscal year guidance specifically due to FC 25 underperformance
- The underperformance cost EA $6 billion in market value
- Revenue declined year-over-year in the quarter FC 25 was the marquee release
- User reception was the worst in franchise history
- EA made FC 25 available on Game Pass before the end of its lifecycle
- Multiple Reddit commenters attributed the decline to: lack of innovation, name change confusion, buggy anti-cheat, and general franchise fatigue

### Estimated Sales:
- No specific copy sales figures were found on Reddit
- Based on the severity of EA's guidance cut and $6B market value loss, FC 25 likely sold significantly fewer copies than FC 24
- Industry analysts (cited in gaming media) estimated FC 25 attracted ~7 million fewer players in its initial launch window compared to FC 24
- **The "players" vs "copies sold" distinction is critical** -- EA uses "players" which inflates numbers via EA Play/Game Pass

- Post: "FC 26 is the worst football game of all Fifa series. EA is a disgrace." (r/EASportsFC, score: 136)

### Context on Commercial Performance:
- FC 26 appears to be continuing the downward trend started by FC 25
- It was outsold by both Ghost of Yotei (in UK physical) and Battlefield 6 (across Europe) at/near launch -- historically unprecedented for the FIFA/FC franchise
- The game was discounted 50% within 3 months of release
- Borderlands 4 (not FC 26) was the top-selling game of September 2025 per Circana US data
- EA was acquired for $55B by PIF/Silver Lake at the same time FC 26 launched, potentially creating organizational uncertainty
- The community reception was extremely negative, continuing from FC 25's historically poor ratings
- FC 26 still topped Black Friday charts in Europe (Dec 2025), suggesting the franchise retains a large casual audience despite declining premium sales

### Estimated Sales:
- No specific copy sales figures were found on Reddit for FC 26
- Based on the evidence of being outsold by Ghost of Yotei and BF6, combined with aggressive early discounting, FC 26 likely represents a continued decline from FC 25
- However, FC 26 was still a top Black Friday seller, suggesting the franchise maintains mass market appeal at discounted prices

# SECTION 4: BROADER FRANCHISE CONTEXT FROM REDDIT

## FIFA/FC Franchise Revenue Context:
1. **Ultimate Team Revenue:** EA's net revenue from Ultimate Team reached $6 billion cumulative from 2015-2020 (r/Games, May 2020, score: 544). By 2025, this figure is likely far higher.
2. **EA's Total Revenue:** EA generated approximately $1.88 billion in Q3 FY25 alone (r/Games, Feb 2025), with FC being a major revenue driver.
3. **$55 Billion Valuation:** EA was acquired for $55B in 2025 (r/gaming, r/Games, r/EASportsFC, r/pcgaming -- multiple posts), with the FC/FIFA franchise and its microtransaction revenue being a core driver of that valuation.
4. **College Football Surpassed FIFA:** EA Sports College Football 25 became the all-time best-selling sports video game in US history by dollar sales (r/Games, Dec 2024), surpassing the FIFA/FC franchise.
5. **FIFA Dominance in Europe:** FIFA/FC has been explicitly acknowledged as THE dominant European game franchise. Hogwarts Legacy was called "Europe's fastest-selling game that isn't FIFA" (r/Games, Mar 2023).
6. **71% Live Service Revenue:** 71% of EA's revenue comes from live service games, with FIFA/FC being the largest contributor (r/pcgaming, May 2022).

## Key Narrative: Declining Trajectory
Reddit posts collectively paint a picture of a franchise in decline from 2023-2025:
- **FIFA 23 (2022-2023):** Peak performance, boosted by last-ever-FIFA branding and World Cup
- **EA Sports FC 24 (2023-2024):** Solid transition, reportedly increased player counts vs FIFA 23
- **EA Sports FC 25 (2024-2025):** Confirmed commercial disappointment -- $6B market cap loss, worst user ratings ever, fiscal year guidance cut
- **EA Sports FC 26 (2025-2026):** Continuing decline -- outsold by multiple competitors at launch, 50% discount within 3 months, poor community reception

## Players vs Copies Sold Distinction:
- EA consistently reports "players" rather than "copies sold"
- "Players" includes EA Play subscribers, Game Pass users, and trial players
- Multiple Reddit commenters noted this distinction, calling it "corny" (u/vKEVUv)
- Actual copy sales are likely 30-50% lower than reported player counts

# SECTION 6: NOTES ON DATA LIMITATIONS

1. **EA does not publicly report specific copy sales figures for individual FIFA/FC titles.** They report "players" and aggregate revenue in quarterly earnings.
2. **Reddit is not a primary source for granular sales data.** Most sales figures discussed on Reddit reference external sources (Circana/NPD, GSD/GfK European data, EA earnings calls, journalist reports).
3. **The most reliable Reddit data for this franchise concerns relative performance** -- e.g., FC 25 underperformed vs FC 24, FC 26 was outsold by BF6, etc. -- rather than absolute unit numbers.
4. **Physical sales data** (UK boxed charts) is frequently discussed on Reddit but represents only ~10-15% of the total market.
5. **The "players" vs "copies sold" distinction** is critical and is something Reddit users frequently highlight as a way EA inflates apparent engagement numbers.
