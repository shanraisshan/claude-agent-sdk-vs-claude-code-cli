# SECTION 4: FRANCHISE-WIDE CONTEXT

## EA/FIFA Revenue and Valuation
1. **$55 billion acquisition**: EA was acquired by PIF/Silver Lake/Affinity Partners in September 2025 (multiple posts across r/Games, r/gaming, r/pcgaming, r/EASportsFC).
2. **Q3 FY2025 revenue**: $1.88 billion for a single quarter (post 1ihva33), with FC being a major driver.
3. **Ultimate Team revenue**: EA has historically generated billions from FUT microtransactions. Community noted this as a driver of the $55B valuation.
4. **FIFA/FC is EA's cash cow**: Multiple Reddit comments describe FC as the franchise that "carried EA through other flops" (post 1i8x6am, u/Forestl, score 473).

## Declining Trajectory (2023-2025)
Reddit posts collectively document a franchise in decline:
- **FIFA 23** (2022): Peak -- 10.3M first-week players, record launch, World Cup boost
- **EA Sports FC 24** (2023): Solid transition -- #1 Europe, strong playtime, successful rebrand
- **EA Sports FC 25** (2024): Clear failure -- $6B market cap loss, fiscal guidance cut, worst user ratings, half-price in 7 weeks
- **EA Sports FC 26** (2025): Continued decline -- outsold by competitors at launch, 50% off in 3 months, not top US seller in launch month

## Players vs Copies Sold
- EA consistently reports "players" rather than "copies sold"
- "Players" includes EA Play subscribers, Game Pass users, trial users
- Reddit commenters frequently note this distinction as misleading (u/vKEVUv, u/Stumpy493)
- Actual copies sold are significantly lower than reported player counts

## Data Limitations
1. EA does not publicly report specific per-title copy sales figures
2. Reddit discussions reference external sources (Circana, GSD, EA earnings) rather than providing original unit sales data
3. The most reliable Reddit data concerns relative performance (FC 25 vs FC 24, FC 26 vs competitors) rather than absolute numbers
4. Physical sales data (UK boxed charts) represents only ~10-15% of total market
5. No Reddit post was found with specific total lifetime copies sold for any individual FIFA/FC title from 2023-2025
