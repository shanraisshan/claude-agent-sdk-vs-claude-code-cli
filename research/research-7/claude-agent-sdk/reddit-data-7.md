# SECTION 3: PER-GAME SUMMARY -- GAME TITLES AND COPY SALES DATA

## Game 1: FIFA 23
- **Release Date**: September 30, 2022
- **Platforms**: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch (Legacy Edition)
- **Status in 2023-2025 Window**: Actively sold throughout most of 2023. Was the current FIFA title at the start of 2023. Delisted from digital storefronts (Steam, etc.) in September 2023 when EA Sports FC 24 launched and the FIFA license expired.
- **Key Sales Context**:
  - Last game under the FIFA brand name
  - Featured the 2022 FIFA World Cup mode (free update in November 2022) which was a massive engagement and sales driver into early 2023
  - Was among the top-selling games on Steam at launch in September 2022
  - In Europe, was #1 best-selling game -- "Hogwarts Legacy is Europe's fastest-selling game (that isn't FIFA) for a generation" (March 2023, r/Games, score: 5086) -- implying FIFA 23 was outselling everything else in Europe
  - Was delisted from digital storefronts in September 2023 due to license expiry

  - **No specific unit sales figure was found on Reddit for FIFA 23.** EA does not publicly disclose per-title unit sales for FIFA/FC games.
  - Contextual data: EA reported FIFA 23 had "record" engagement. The FIFA franchise historically sells 15-20+ million copies per year. FIFA 23 benefited massively from the 2022 World Cup (held in November-December 2022), driving sales well into 2023.
  - Reddit user comments reference FIFA as consistently the #1 selling game in Europe annually.

  - EA publicly announced FC 24 attracted "14.5 million players in its first month" making it "the biggest and fastest growing EA Sports FC game ever" (this figure was referenced in EA press materials discussed across Reddit, though no single dedicated post with this exact data surfaced in the Reddit search results).
  - FC 24 was referenced as the baseline against which FC 25 underperformed, suggesting FC 24 was considered a commercial success.

  - EA lost $6 billion in market value following the news (r/Games, score: 1952)
  - EA Q3 revenue fell to $1.88B from $1.94B, "due in part to weakness in sales for its football game EA Sports FC" (r/Games, score: 254)
  - Despite the underperformance narrative, FC 25 was STILL the #1 best-selling game in Europe for H1 2025 (17/17 tracked European countries) per VGChartz/GSD data (r/Games, score: 190)
  - Community reception was very negative: "EA FC 25 is probably the least effort EA has ever put in" (r/EASportsFC, score: 510)

- **Copies Sold (Reddit-sourced data)**:
  - **No specific unit sales figure was found on Reddit for EA Sports FC 25.**
  - The underperformance was reported in terms of EA's revenue/forecast decline rather than specific unit numbers.
  - EA's own reporting focuses on "net bookings" and "players" rather than copies sold. The decline in net bookings for the EA Sports segment was the primary metric discussed.
  - Reddit commentary suggests FC 25 sold significantly fewer copies than FC 24, with both copy sales and Ultimate Team microtransaction spending declining. One commenter noted: "People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore."
  - Context: Even in an "underperformance" year, FC 25 topped all European sales charts for H1 2025, suggesting it still sold millions of copies -- it just sold fewer than EA expected and fewer than FC 24.

## Game 4: EA Sports FC 26
- **Release Date**: September 2025 (approximately September 12-19, 2025 based on Reddit activity)
- **Platforms**: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC (likely dropped last-gen PS4/Xbox One and Nintendo Switch based on FC 26 posts; Nintendo Switch 2 may have been added)
- **Status in 2023-2025 Window**: The latest/current title as of early 2026. Released in the latter part of the 2023-2025 research window.
- **Key Sales Context**:
  - Official reveal trailer posted July 16, 2025 (r/EASportsFC, score: 746)
  - Launch update posted approximately September 12, 2025 (r/EASportsFC, score: 168)
  - Ghost of Yotei beat FC 26 in UK physical sales at launch (r/gaming, score: 1242) -- though physical sales are a small fraction of total
  - Battlefield 6 beat FC 26 launch sales in Europe (r/gaming, score: 895) -- "GSD data is purely premium sales"
  - FC 26 was among Europe's top sellers during Black Friday 2025 (r/Games, score: 222) -- but was already 50% off less than 3 months after release
  - FC 26 was affected by the EA acquisition announcement ($55 billion by PIF/Silver Lake/Affinity Partners, September 2025)
  - PC input delay mega-thread suggests significant technical issues at launch (r/EASportsFC, score: 728)

- **Copies Sold (Reddit-sourced data)**:
  - **No specific unit sales figure was found on Reddit for EA Sports FC 26.**
  - Relative performance data: BF6 beat FC 26 at launch in Europe, and Ghost of Yotei beat it in UK physical sales -- both unusual for the FC/FIFA franchise, which traditionally dominates European launch charts.
  - The aggressive discounting (50% off within 3 months) suggests EA may have been trying to boost sales volume.
  - Being a top seller during Black Friday 2025 in Europe suggests millions of copies were still moving despite not dominating launches as in prior years.

## Game 5: EA Sports FC Mobile (free-to-play)
- **Release Date**: Ongoing free-to-play title (rebranded from FIFA Mobile)
- **Platforms**: iOS, Android
- **Status in 2023-2025 Window**: Continuously active. Rebranded from FIFA Mobile to EA Sports FC Mobile in 2023 alongside the console rebrand.
- **Key Context**:

  - Has an active community on r/FUTMobile
  - "R.I.P. EA FC MOBILE" post (r/FUTMobile, score: 220) mourns the game's direction
  - Player mentioned playing since "October 2023" -- aligns with FC 24 cycle
  - Shard system introduced in 2025
  - **Not counted for copy sales research** as it is a free-to-play title with no purchase required

# SECTION 4: KEY FINDINGS AND CROSS-REFERENCE NOTES

## Summary of Games Identified (2023-2025 window):

| # | Title | Release Date | Type | Copy Sales Found on Reddit? |
|---|-------|-------------|------|---------------------------|
| 1 | FIFA 23 | Sept 30, 2022 | Paid (actively sold into 2023, delisted Sept 2023) | No specific figure found |
| 2 | EA Sports FC 24 | Sept 29, 2023 | Paid | No specific figure; EA claimed 14.5M players in first month |
| 3 | EA Sports FC 25 | Sept 27, 2024 | Paid | No specific figure; confirmed underperformance vs FC 24 |
| 4 | EA Sports FC 26 | ~Sept 2025 | Paid | No specific figure; BF6 beat it at European launch |
| 5 | EA Sports FC Mobile | Ongoing (F2P) | Free-to-play | N/A (F2P -- no copies sold) |

## Key Observations from Reddit Research:

1. **EA does not publicly disclose per-title unit sales for FIFA/FC games.** They report "players" (which includes EA Play/Game Pass trial users) and "net bookings" (which includes microtransactions). This is why no specific "copies sold" figure was found on any Reddit post.

2. **The FIFA/FC franchise consistently dominates European sales charts.** Even in an "underperformance" year (FC 25), it was #1 in all 17 tracked European countries for H1 2025.

3. **The World Cup effect** was a major driver for FIFA 23 (2022 World Cup held November-December 2022, driving sales into 2023).

4. **The brand transition from FIFA to EA Sports FC** was a major narrative in 2023. EA was legally required to delist FIFA-branded games when FC 24 launched.

5. **FC 25 was the most notable decline** in the franchise's recent history, causing EA to slash its fiscal year forecast and lose $6 billion in market value. The underperformance was discussed extensively across r/Games, r/gaming, r/pcgaming, and r/EASportsFC.

6. **FC 26** launched September 2025 with mixed signals -- it lost UK physical launch sales to Ghost of Yotei and was beaten by Battlefield 6 in Europe, but was still a top seller during Black Friday 2025. Aggressive discounting (50% off within 3 months) was noted.

7. **Historical franchise sales context**: The FIFA franchise has sold over 325 million copies total across its 30+ year history (commonly cited figure across gaming media, referenced indirectly in the "Best Selling Video Game Franchises Ever" Reddit post). Individual titles in the modern era (FIFA 17-23) have typically sold in the 15-25 million copy range per year, based on industry estimates cited in various Reddit discussions.

## Revenue Context (from Reddit posts about EA earnings):
- EA's Q3 FY2025 revenue: $1.88 billion (down from $1.94B), partially due to FC 25 weakness
- EA Sports segment (primarily FC/FIFA + Madden) is EA's largest revenue driver
- EA was acquired for $55 billion in 2025, with the FC franchise being one of its most valuable assets

# SECTION 5: RAW POST DETAILS (Extended excerpts from key posts)

## Detailed Comment Thread: "EA lost $6 billion in market value" (1i8x6am)
- Comment by Cynical_onlooker (score 1146): "Honestly, the thing that surprises me most about this news was how realistic EA's expectations were for the sales. 3 million should be more than obtainable for a high budget AAA fantasy RPG nowadays. I do wonder how much more of a leash they're going to give Bioware."
- Comment by Forestl (score 472): "Most of this is because of FC doing badly. They've made a shit ton of money from that game and it has helped them through other flops. To see those numbers going down is very bad"
- Comment by FlukyS (score 187): "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual. Like the last 2 releases had the new anticheat that has been buggy as shit, they still are charging the full price even though they haven't added anything of value really in the last few releases... I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm excited to see what 2k do with the FIFA license."
- Comment by orze (score 162): "Surprise the FIFA game is doing badly, don't know if it's the name change or FINALLY people got tired of it?"
