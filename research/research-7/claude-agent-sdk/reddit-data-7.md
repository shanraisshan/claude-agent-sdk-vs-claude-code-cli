  - According_Garlic_431 (score 30): "sadly only steam numbers are known. i would love to see this numbers across all platforms"
  - HazzaThePug (score 5): "I would be extremely interested to match this with console numbers... '25 was probably the most clowned on title by the end of its cycle, and I wouldn't be surprised if that has factored into the lower numbers on release."
  - SparksNBolts (score 6): "I'm surprised all time peak is lower this year since almost everyone seems to say PC is a lot better for gameplay compared to console. Makes me think console has definitely dropped more than 12%"
  - StrongAverage1832 (score 1): "Engagement was down from the off due to lower sales. This is the first year they've never put out an official press release and even last years they had to redact/change because it made the game look bad... Popularity peaked in fifa 23 and has been on a downward trend since. It lost percentiles with the name change and further percentiles into 25. 26 was always going to sell worse than 25"
  - DespairRider (score 1): "That's crazy cause FC27 will obviously do worse with the release of GTA at the end of year."
  - tennysonbass (score 2): "I think R9 in swaps is an obvious hail Mary to get people playing... screams that they are losing engagement and felt the need to do something"

# SECTION 4: CROSS-CUTTING THEMES

## Theme 1: "Players" vs "Copies Sold"
EA consistently reports "players" rather than "copies sold." Reddit users are acutely aware of this distinction:
- EA Play subscribers get trial/limited access and are counted as "players"
- Game Pass users (when applicable) counted
- PS Plus trial users counted
- GeForce Now subscription players counted
- **Reddit consensus: actual copy purchasers are approximately 75-80% of reported "player" counts**
- Sources: Multiple comments across posts 1i7m0ck, 1qvnm2k

## Theme 2: FIFA 23 World Cup Boost
- The 2022 Qatar World Cup (Nov-Dec 2022) provided massive engagement/sales boost to FIFA 23
- EA integrated a dedicated World Cup mode into FIFA 23
- This was the last World Cup on a FIFA-branded game
- The World Cup effect is widely cited on Reddit as the reason FIFA 23 was the franchise peak
- No subsequent title has had an equivalent global sporting event boost
- FIFA 23's Steam peak (110,757) remains the franchise all-time high

## Theme 3: EA Sports FC 24 Rebranding Impact
- Rebrand from "FIFA" to "EA Sports FC" coincided with -3.3% Steam peak decline
- Reddit commenters debate whether name change caused confusion among casual buyers
- EA pulled all previous FIFA titles from digital storefronts simultaneously
- FIFA organization announced plans for rival game (to be made by 2K Games)
- Cost savings: EA no longer paying ~$150-300M+ per year for FIFA naming rights (FIFA asked for "$1 billion" per Reddit)

## Theme 4: EA Sports FC 25 Underperformance
- First title where EA publicly acknowledged underperformance
- Led to EA slashing fiscal year forecast (January 2025)
- Caused $6 billion drop in EA's market value
- Q3 FY25 revenue fell from $1.94B to $1.88B
- Community predicted this from beta -- "the least effort EA has ever put in"
- Steam peak engagement was slightly UP (+1.3%) -- suggesting revenue decline came primarily from reduced microtransaction spending, not necessarily fewer copy purchases
- Despite underperformance: STILL #1 selling game in all of Europe H1 2025

## Theme 5: EA Sports FC 26 Continued Decline
- First year EA never issued an official press release about player numbers
- Steam engagement down 12% -- biggest single-year drop in franchise's recent history
- Lost UK physical sales chart-topping position to Ghost of Yotei
- Outsold at European launch by Battlefield 6 (another EA title)
- Still performed well during Black Friday 2025 (though with aggressive 50% discounting)
- Community reception extremely negative (input delay, "worst FIFA ever")
- Console decline likely even worse than the 12% Steam decline
- EA being acquired by PIF/Silver Lake for $55B during this period

## Theme 6: Retail Pricing
- FIFA 23: ~$59.99 USD (standard), $69.99 (Ultimate Edition)
- EA Sports FC 24: $69.99 USD (next-gen), $59.99 (last-gen)
- EA Sports FC 25: ~$69.99 USD / 69.99-70 GBP (digital)
- EA Sports FC 26: ~$69.99 USD / 69.99 GBP (digital); UK physical ~59.99 GBP
- FC 26 discounted to 50% off within 3 months of release

## Theme 7: EA Financial Context
- EA acquired for $55 billion in 2025 (PIF/Silver Lake/Affinity Partners)
- 71% of EA revenue from live service games (2022 data)
- EA Sports FC is EA's most important franchise financially
- Decline of FC sales/engagement described as bigger concern than any other EA title
- EA Sports segment revenue is the company's largest

# SECTION 5: ESTIMATED COPIES SOLD SUMMARY

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: EA does not publicly disclose unit sales ("copies sold") for individual FIFA/FC titles. They report "players" which inflates numbers by including subscription/trial users. No Reddit post was found containing an official EA-confirmed copies-sold figure for any of the four titles in the 2023-2025 window.

The following estimates are based on:
1. Steam engagement data from Reddit (Post 1qvnm2k)
2. EA financial reports discussed on Reddit
3. Historical franchise context from Reddit discussions
4. Relative comparison data (BF6, Ghost of Yotei comparisons)

| Title | Release | Est. Copies Sold | Confidence | Key Reddit Evidence |
|-------|---------|-----------------|------------|---------------------|
| FIFA 23 | Sept 2022 | ~25-30M | Medium | Peak franchise; World Cup boost; Steam ATH 110,757; "Popularity peaked in FIFA 23"; dominated European charts |
| EA Sports FC 24 | Sept 2023 | ~20-22M | Low | -3.3% Steam decline; rebrand confusion; EA claimed 14.5M "players" in first month; considered successful baseline |
| EA Sports FC 25 | Sept 2024 | ~16-18M | Low-Medium | EA slashed forecast; $6B market value lost; revenue fell; Steam slightly up but overall revenue down (MTX decline); still #1 in Europe |
| EA Sports FC 26 | Sept 2025 | ~14-16M (early est.) | Low | -12% Steam decline; no press release; UK physical beaten; European launch beaten by BF6; Black Friday strong with 50% discount; too early for full lifecycle |

**CAVEAT**: These estimates are speculative inferences from Reddit data. Actual figures may differ significantly. The "players" numbers EA reports are typically 20-30% higher than actual purchasers per Reddit consensus.
