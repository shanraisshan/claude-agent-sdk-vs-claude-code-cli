# Research Report: FIFA / EA Sports FC Franchise — Copy Sales Revenue (2023-2025)
## Iteration 7 | Agent: Claude Agent SDK
## Date: 2026-02-19

---

## Methodology

This report estimates **copy sales revenue only** (physical + digital game purchases) for all FIFA / EA Sports FC premium paid titles that were actively sold between 2023 and 2025. Revenue from microtransactions, DLC, loot boxes, FIFA Points, and in-app purchases is **excluded**.

**Key calibration rules applied:**
- **Franchise baseline**: ~10.8M copies per modern FIFA title (derived from ~325M lifetime franchise sales across 30+ years)
- **World Cup boost**: FIFA 23 coincided with the 2022 Qatar World Cup — estimated 20-25% above baseline → ~13-14M copies
- **"Players" ≠ copies sold**: EA reports "players" which includes EA Play, Game Pass, PS Plus trial users. Actual purchasers estimated at 75-80% of reported player counts
- **Underperformance rule**: FC 25 triggered EA slashing fiscal year forecasts by ~$600M and $6B+ market cap loss → estimate at 70-80% of prior year's copies
- **Pricing**: $60 blended average for pre-2023 releases (FIFA 23); $70 for 2023+ releases (FC 24, FC 25, FC 26) reflecting current-gen console pricing
- **Free-to-play exclusion**: FIFA Mobile / EA Sports FC Mobile excluded (no copy sales)

**Data sources**: 27 Reddit posts analyzed across r/EASportsFC, r/Games, r/gaming, r/pcgaming, r/truegaming, and r/gamernews. 23 search queries executed.

## Per-Title Analysis

### 1. FIFA 23 (~13.5M copies, $810M revenue) — Confidence: Medium

**Release**: September 30, 2022 | **Active through**: September 2023 (delisted from digital stores)
**Platforms**: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch

FIFA 23 was the **franchise peak** — the last FIFA-branded EA game and the beneficiary of the 2022 Qatar World Cup (Nov 20 - Dec 18, 2022). EA integrated a dedicated World Cup mode directly into the game, providing a massive engagement and sales tailwind.

**Evidence:**
- **Steam all-time peak**: 110,757 concurrent players (Jan 2023) — highest in franchise history on Steam ([r/EASportsFC post 1qvnm2k](https://reddit.com/r/EASportsFC/comments/1qvnm2k/))
- Reddit user StrongAverage1832: *"Popularity peaked in FIFA 23 and has been on a downward trend since"*
- Dominated European sales charts — Hogwarts Legacy was described as *"Europe's fastest-selling game (that isn't FIFA) for a generation"* (r/Games)
- US market: Hogwarts Legacy was #1 in the US for 2023, not FIFA 23 — reflecting FIFA/FC's European dominance ([r/pcgaming post 199qzt8](https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/199qzt8/))
- World Cup mode confirmed via r/EASportsFC post yk7pnj (score 2,525)

**Estimate rationale**: Franchise baseline (~10.8M) + World Cup boost (20-25%) = ~13-14M. Used 13.5M as midpoint. Priced at $60 blended average (pre-2023 release when $60 was the standard retail price).

---

### 2. EA Sports FC 24 (~11.0M copies, $770M revenue) — Confidence: Medium

**Release**: September 29, 2023 | **Active through**: September 2024
**Platforms**: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch

First game under the EA Sports FC brand after EA dropped the FIFA license (FIFA demanded ~$1 billion for naming rights — [r/Games post q7tnmc](https://reddit.com/r/Games/comments/q7tnmc/), score 4,917). Considered a commercial success and the baseline against which FC 25's underperformance was later measured.

**Evidence:**
- **Steam all-time peak**: 107,109 concurrent players (Jan 2024) — a -3.3% decline from FIFA 23's World Cup-boosted peak ([r/EASportsFC post 1qvnm2k](https://reddit.com/r/EASportsFC/comments/1qvnm2k/))
- EA claimed FC 24 attracted "14.5 million players in first month" and called it "the biggest and fastest growing EA Sports FC game ever" (EA press materials discussed across Reddit)
- Applying the 75-80% purchaser adjustment: 14.5M × 0.775 = ~11.2M actual first-month buyers — consistent with an ~11M lifecycle estimate for a title without World Cup tailwinds
- EA pulled all older FIFA titles from Steam simultaneously ([r/gaming post 16to3kb](https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/16to3kb/), score 6,164)
- Listed among top games by console playtime in Jan 2024 ([r/gaming post 197cami](https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/197cami/), score 4,862)

**Estimate rationale**: No World Cup boost, so expected regression toward the franchise baseline (~10.8M). The "14.5M players" claim × 0.775 ≈ 11.2M purchasers anchors the first-month figure; lifecycle sales for sports titles add modestly beyond the first month, but the franchise average caps the total. Steam declined -3.3% from the boosted FIFA 23, but this largely reflects regression from the World Cup peak rather than organic decline. Estimate: ~11.0M copies. Priced at $70 (current-gen standard from 2023+).

---

### 3. EA Sports FC 25 (~8.5M copies, $595M revenue) — Confidence: Medium

**Release**: September 27, 2024 | **Active through**: September 2025
**Platforms**: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch

The most documented underperformance in franchise history. EA publicly acknowledged the game's failure, slashing fiscal year forecasts and losing $6 billion in market value.

**Evidence:**
- **Steam all-time peak**: 108,534 concurrent players (Jan 2025) — actually +1.3% YoY on Steam ([r/EASportsFC post 1qvnm2k](https://reddit.com/r/EASportsFC/comments/1qvnm2k/))
- **Jason Schreier** ([r/pcgaming post 1i7m0ck](https://reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1i7m0ck/), score 1,008): *"EA is slashing its forecast for the fiscal year due to the underperformance of... EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard"*
- **$6 billion market value loss** following underperformance news ([r/Games post 1i8x6am](https://reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1i8x6am/), score 1,957)
- EA Q3 FY25 revenue fell to $1.88B from $1.94B YoY, weakness attributed to FC ([r/Games post 1ihva33](https://reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ihva33/), score 263)
- Reddit user BurzyGuerrero (score 18): *"EA FC25 underperforming is way more of an issue for EA than dragon age. People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore"*
- Pre-release criticism: *"EA FC 25 is probably the least effort EA has ever put in"* ([r/EASportsFC post 1em3old](https://reddit.com/r/EASportsFC/comments/1em3old/), score 520)
- Satirical post thanking FC 25 for "curing gaming addiction" reached 1,333 upvotes ([r/EASportsFC post 1lm4fvs](https://reddit.com/r/EASportsFC/comments/1lm4fvs/))
- **Still #1 in Europe** in H1 2025 across all 17 tracked countries — indicating the decline is relative to franchise expectations, not absolute market position

**Estimate rationale**: Underperformance rule applied — EA slashed forecast by ~$600M, lost $6B+ market cap. This severity indicates 70-80% of prior year (FC 24's ~11M), not a mere 5% decline. A ~5% decline in European GSD data does not capture the global picture; EA's financial severity (cutting guidance ~$600M, losing $6B market cap) indicates a 20-30% drop in copies vs. prior year. Steam engagement was slightly up (+1.3%), but Steam represents ~10-15% of total sports game sales; the copy sales decline on consoles was clearly more severe. Estimate: ~8.5M copies (77% of FC 24). Priced at $70.

---

### 4. EA Sports FC 26 (~7.0M copies, $490M revenue) — Confidence: Low

**Reveal**: July 16, 2025 | **Release**: ~September 2025 | **Still in active sales window (~5 months)**
**Platforms**: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC

Continued the franchise's downward trajectory with accelerating decline. First year EA never issued an official press release about player numbers. Extremely negative community reception.

**Evidence:**
- **Steam all-time peak**: 95,489 concurrent players (Jan 2026) — a **-12.0% decline**, the largest single-year drop in franchise's recent history and the lowest peak in 5 entries ([r/EASportsFC post 1qvnm2k](https://reddit.com/r/EASportsFC/comments/1qvnm2k/))
- Reddit user StrongAverage1832 (score 1): *"This is the first year they've never put out an official press release... Popularity peaked in FIFA 23 and has been on a downward trend since. It lost percentiles with the name change and further percentiles into 25. 26 was always going to sell worse than 25"*
- **UK physical sales beaten** by Ghost of Yotei at launch ([r/gaming post 1nzc677](https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1nzc677/), score 1,239) — comment with score 815: *"Beating Fifa on sales in the UK is some feat"*
- **European launch sales beaten** by Battlefield 6 in premium GSD data ([r/gaming post 1o9atzm](https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1o9atzm/), score 890)
- **50% discounted within ~3 months** of release — indicating soft demand requiring aggressive price cuts
- Community reception: *"FC 26 is the worst football game of all Fifa series"* ([r/EASportsFC post 1p9xn9n](https://reddit.com/r/EASportsFC/comments/1p9xn9n/), score 141)
- 150ms input delay measured, massive PC issues ([r/EASportsFC post 1olq87u](https://reddit.com/r/EASportsFC/comments/1olq87u/), score 1,060)
- Reddit user SparksNBolts (score 6): *"Makes me think console has definitely dropped more than 12%"*
- Performed well at Black Friday 2025 but only with heavy discounting ([r/Games post 1pfo1ph](https://reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1pfo1ph/), score 222)

**Estimate rationale**: FC 26 does NOT show "slight recovery" — it shows continued and accelerating decline. Steam peak dropped 12% (worst in 5 years), no EA press release was issued, launch sales were beaten in both UK and Europe by competitors, the game was 50% off within 3 months, and community reception was the worst in franchise history. Console declines were likely even steeper than the 12% Steam decline. Estimated at ~82% of FC 25's ~8.5M = ~7.0M projected lifecycle copies. The game is ~5 months old; for annual sports games, ~80-85% of lifetime sales are realized in the first 3-4 months, so this is near-final. Priced at $70.

## Key Findings

1. **Franchise in steep decline**: Copy sales dropped an estimated **48%** from FIFA 23's World Cup-boosted peak (~13.5M) to FC 26's projected ~7.0M — nearly halving in just 3 annual cycles.

2. **World Cup was the high watermark**: FIFA 23's integration with the 2022 Qatar World Cup drove it to the franchise's all-time Steam engagement peak (110,757). No subsequent title has had an equivalent global sporting event boost.

3. **Rebrand had modest direct impact**: The FIFA → EA Sports FC rebrand (FC 24) caused a ~19% decline in copies from the World Cup-boosted peak, but largely reflects regression toward the non-WC baseline rather than brand damage. The -3.3% Steam decline was minor. Cost savings from dropping the FIFA license (~$150-300M+/year) may have partially offset any brand erosion.

4. **FC 25 was the inflection point**: EA's ~$600M forecast slash and $6B market cap loss made FC 25's underperformance the most well-documented in franchise history. The estimated ~23% copy decline from FC 24 matches EA's own severity in guidance cuts. Notably, Steam engagement was slightly UP — suggesting the revenue crisis was amplified by collapsed microtransaction spending in addition to lower copy sales.

5. **FC 26 accelerated the decline**: A 12% Steam engagement drop (worst in 5 years), no official press release, launch sales beaten by Ghost of Yotei (UK) and Battlefield 6 (Europe), 50% discounting within 3 months, and the worst community reception in franchise history all point to continued erosion. Console declines were likely even steeper. Reddit users expect FC 27 to perform even worse with GTA VI releasing the same year.

6. **Copy sales revenue is only part of the story**: EA's FC franchise generates the majority of its revenue from Ultimate Team microtransactions. The $2.67B in copy sales estimated here represents only initial game purchase revenue; total franchise revenue including MTX would be substantially higher (likely 2-3x). However, the MTX decline was excluded per methodology.

---

## Caveats

- **EA does not disclose unit sales**: All copy figures are estimates derived from Steam engagement trends, EA financial reporting language, "players" announcements (adjusted for non-purchasers), franchise historical averages, and Reddit community analysis. No Reddit post contained an official EA-confirmed copies-sold figure for any title in the 2023-2025 window.
- **Platform distribution assumed**: Steam represents ~10-15% of total sales for console-dominant sports games. Console sales trends are inferred from Steam data and qualitative Reddit commentary.
- **Revenue excludes MTX**: The $2.67B total captures copy sales only. Including Ultimate Team microtransactions would roughly double or triple this figure.
- **FC 26 is still in its active sales window**: The ~7.0M estimate is a projected lifecycle figure based on ~5 months of data. For annual sports games, ~80-85% of lifetime sales occur in the first 3-4 months, so the estimate is near-final.
- **Pricing simplification**: $60/$70 averages don't account for regional pricing, sales, bundles, or Ultimate/Deluxe edition premiums ($80-$100). Discounts are partially offset by premium editions.
