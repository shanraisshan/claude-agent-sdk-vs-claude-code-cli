## Per-Game Sales Summary

### FIFA 23 (last FIFA-branded game, active in 2023)
- **Copies Sold**: Estimated ~10-12 million copies (lifetime)
- **Sources**: No specific Reddit post with exact numbers found for FIFA 23 standalone sales. Based on Reddit discussions, FIFA titles historically sell 10-15 million copies per year. FIFA 23 was noted as performing well, being the final FIFA-branded title. EA reported strong FY2023 results with FIFA franchise contributing significantly.
- **Confidence**: Medium

### EA Sports FC 24 (September 2023)
- **Copies Sold**: Estimated ~8-11 million copies (lifetime)
- **Sources**: No exact sales figures disclosed by EA on Reddit. However, the game was added to PlayStation Plus in May 2024 (7 months post-launch), suggesting sales slowed. Reddit discussions indicate the transition from FIFA to FC branding caused some confusion and reduced brand recognition. Still performed well commercially as the first FC-branded title.
- **Confidence**: Low-Medium

### EA Sports FC 25 (September 2024)
- **Copies Sold**: Estimated ~6-9 million copies (lifetime)
- **Sources**: Multiple Reddit threads discuss FC 25 underperformance. EA slashed fiscal year forecast in January 2025 partly due to FC 25. EA lost $6 billion in market value. However, FC 25 still topped European sales charts for H1 2025 (#1 in all 17 tracked countries). EA's expected revenue was ~$7.5B but came in at ~$7.15B across all products. Reddit commenters note this is "still going up" in absolute terms but missing projections.
- **Confidence**: Medium

### EA Sports FC 26 (October 2025)
- **Copies Sold**: Estimated ~5-8 million copies (as of early 2026, still actively selling)
- **Sources**: Ghost of Yotei beat FC 26 in UK physical sales at launch. However, physical sales represent only ~10% of total sales. The game is still in its active sales window. The Saudi acquisition of EA ($55B) validates the continued commercial importance of the FC franchise.
- **Confidence**: Low (game still in active sales window)
