# Research Report: FIFA / EA Sports FC Games (2023-2025)
## Iteration 2 — Claude Agent SDK

**Research Date:** February 19, 2026
**Scope:** All FIFA-franchise games released from 2023 to 2025, copy sales (physical + digital) only. No microtransactions, DLC, loot boxes, or in-app purchases.

---

## Executive Summary

Between 2023 and 2025, four mainline FIFA/EA Sports FC titles were available (FIFA 23 released late 2022 but actively sold through 2023; EA Sports FC 24, FC 25, and FC 26). The franchise underwent a major rebrand from "FIFA" to "EA Sports FC" in 2023 after FIFA org demanded ~$1 billion per 4-year cycle for naming rights. No traditional FIFA-organization-branded console/PC game was released by any other publisher during this period.

**Critical data limitation:** EA does **not** publicly disclose per-title unit sales. They report "players" (which includes EA Play/Game Pass/PS Plus trial users) rather than "copies sold," and report revenue at the franchise level (bundling copy sales with microtransactions). All copy-sold figures are **estimates** derived from 32 Reddit posts, EA earnings data discussed on Reddit, chart performance, and historical franchise benchmarks.

**Total estimated copy-sale revenue (2023–2025): ~$2.72 billion across ~42 million copies (4 titles).**

---

## Important Methodology Notes

No Reddit post contained a specific, sourced "X million copies sold" figure for any individual FIFA/FC title. All estimates derive from:

- EA's reported "14.5 million players in the first week" for FC 24 (includes non-purchase access)
- Historical FIFA franchise sales benchmarks (~10–12M copies/year)
- European and US chart performance (Circana/NPD, VGChartz GSD data)
- EA fiscal earnings reports and forecast revisions discussed on Reddit
- Timing of PS Plus / Game Pass inclusion (signals premium sales window closure)
- Comparative launch performance (BF6 vs FC 26, GoY vs FC 26)
- Discount timing (50% off within 2–3 months = weaker initial demand)
- Pricing data (standard $69.99 current-gen, $59.99 last-gen/PC, $39.99 Switch)

**Confidence Scale:**
- **High** — Multiple corroborating data sources, narrow estimate range
- **Medium** — Reasonable indirect evidence, moderate estimate range (±20%)
- **Low** — Limited data, wide estimate range (±30%+) or too early for reliable totals

## A. Revenue Table

Revenue = Copies Sold × Average Retail Price at Launch. Only physical + digital copy sales. **Excludes** microtransactions, FUT points, DLC, loot boxes, and all in-app purchases.

| # | Title | Year | Copies Sold (Est.) | Avg. Retail Price | Revenue (USD) | Confidence |
|---|-------|------|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | FIFA 23 | 2022 | ~11.0M | $60 | ~$660,000,000 | Medium |
| 2 | EA Sports FC 24 | 2023 | ~12.5M | $65 | ~$812,500,000 | Medium |
| 3 | EA Sports FC 25 | 2024 | ~9.5M | $65 | ~$617,500,000 | Low-Medium |
| 4 | EA Sports FC 26 | 2025 | ~9.0M | $70 | ~$630,000,000 | Low |
| — | EA Sports FC Mobile | 2023–25 | N/A (F2P) | N/A | N/A | — |
| — | FIFA-branded (non-EA) | 2023–25 | None released | N/A | N/A | — |
| | **TOTAL** | | **~42.0M** | | **~$2.72B** | |

*Note: FIFA 23 was released September 30, 2022, but was the last FIFA-branded game and was actively sold through September 2023. Included as the "2023-active" FIFA title.*

### Pricing Assumptions

| Title | PS5/XSX | PS4/XB1/PC | Switch | Blended Average |
|-------|---------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| FIFA 23 | $69.99 | $59.99 | $39.99 | ~$60 |
| EA Sports FC 24 | $69.99 | $59.99 | $39.99 | ~$65 |
| EA Sports FC 25 | $69.99 | $59.99 | $39.99 | ~$65 |
| EA Sports FC 26 | $69.99 | N/A (dropped) | N/A (dropped) | ~$70 |

FIFA 23 weighted lower (~$60) due to larger last-gen/Switch install base at that time. FC 26 weighted higher (~$70) because it dropped last-gen and Switch entirely.

## Key Caveats

1. **EA does not disclose unit sales.** All "copies sold" figures are estimates based on indirect evidence from Reddit. True figures could be ±30% from estimates.

2. **"Players" ≠ "Copies Sold."** EA's reported player counts include users who access via EA Play, Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, and free trials — not just purchasers.

3. **The FIFA/EA FC franchise's primary revenue driver is Ultimate Team microtransactions**, not copy sales. EA's concern about FC 25 "underperformance" was primarily about declining net bookings (heavily weighted toward microtransaction spending).

4. **The ~$2.72B total represents copy sales revenue only.** Including Ultimate Team microtransactions, the FC franchise likely generated several times this amount during 2022–2025.

5. **FC 26 data is incomplete** (~5 months post-launch). The final lifetime estimate will likely be higher.

6. **The FIFA-to-FC rebrand** did not significantly impact initial sales for FC 24, but declining engagement across FC 25 and FC 26 suggests franchise fatigue may be accelerating.

7. **No FIFA-organization-branded traditional game shipped 2023–2025.** FIFA's blockchain/mobile titles and 2K partnership rumor did not produce a console/PC competitor.

8. **Uncertainty range for total revenue: approximately $1.9B – $3.5B** (±30% from the $2.72B midpoint estimate).
