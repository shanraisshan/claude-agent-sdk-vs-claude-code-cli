# Research Report: FIFA / EA Sports FC Games (2023-2025) — Copy Sales & Revenue

## Iteration 2 — Claude Agent SDK

**Research Date:** February 19, 2026
**Scope:** All FIFA-franchise games released from 2023 to 2025, copy sales (physical + digital) only. No microtransactions, DLC, loot boxes, or in-app purchases.

---

## Executive Summary

Between 2023 and 2025, three mainline EA Sports FC titles were released (EA Sports FC 24, FC 25, and FC 26), following the franchise rebrand from "FIFA" after EA's licensing deal expired. FIFA 23 (released Sep 2022) was the last game under the FIFA name and continued selling through 2023. No traditional FIFA-organization-branded console/PC game was released by any other publisher during this period — FIFA org partnered with Netflix/Delphi in December 2025, but no product shipped.

**Critical data limitation:** EA does **not** publicly disclose per-title unit sales. They report "players" (which includes EA Play/Game Pass/PS Plus trial users) rather than "copies sold," and report revenue at the franchise level (bundling copy sales with microtransactions). All copy-sold figures are **estimates** derived from 39 Reddit posts, EA earnings data discussed on Reddit, chart performance, and historical franchise benchmarks across 65 search queries.

**Total estimated copy-sale revenue (2023–2025): ~$1.40 billion across ~27 million copies (3 titles released in window).**

---

## Important Methodology Notes

No Reddit post contained a specific, sourced "X million copies sold" figure for any individual FIFA/FC title. The only concrete unit figure found was **905,000 copies of FC 25 on PlayStation in June 2025** (a single month, single platform, heavily discounted). All other estimates derive from:

- EA's reported "14.5 million players in the first week" for FC 24 (includes non-purchase access)
- Historical FIFA franchise sales benchmarks (~10–12M copies/year)
- European and US chart performance (Circana/NPD, VGChartz GSD data)
- EA fiscal earnings reports and forecast revisions discussed on Reddit
- Timing of PS Plus / Game Pass inclusion (signals premium sales window closure)
- Comparative launch performance (BF6 vs FC 26, GoY vs FC 26)
- Discount timing (50% off within 2–3 months = weaker initial demand)
- Steam player count benchmarks (FC 24: ~46K, FC 25: ~53K, FC 26: ~49K in January)

**Confidence Scale:**
- **High** — Multiple corroborating data sources, narrow estimate range
- **Medium** — Reasonable indirect evidence, moderate estimate range (±20%)
- **Medium-Low** — Mixed signals, wider estimate range (±25%)
- **Low** — Limited data, wide estimate range (±30%+) or too early for reliable totals

## A. Revenue Table

Revenue = Copies Sold × Average Retail Price. Only physical + digital copy sales. **Excludes** microtransactions, FUT points, DLC, loot boxes, and all in-app purchases.

| # | Title | Year | Copies Sold (Est.) | Avg. Retail Price | Revenue (USD) | Confidence |
|---|-------|------|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | EA Sports FC 24 | 2023 | ~12,000,000 | $57 | ~$684,000,000 | Medium |
| 2 | EA Sports FC 25 | 2024 | ~9,000,000 | $45 | ~$405,000,000 | Medium-Low |
| 3 | EA Sports FC 26 | 2025 | ~6,000,000* | $52 | ~$312,000,000 | Low |
| — | EA Sports FC Mobile | 2023–25 | N/A (F2P) | N/A | N/A | — |
| — | FIFA-branded (non-EA) | 2023–25 | None released | N/A | N/A | — |
| | **TOTAL** | | **~27,000,000** | | **~$1.40B** | |

*\*FC 26 figure is partial-year only (~5 months of sales as of Feb 2026). Lifetime sales will likely reach 8–11M.*

### Pricing Assumptions

| Title | PS5/XSX MSRP | PS4/XB1/PC MSRP | Switch MSRP | Blended Avg. (incl. discounts) |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| EA Sports FC 24 | $69.99 | $59.99 | $39.99 | ~$57 |
| EA Sports FC 25 | $69.99 | $59.99 | $39.99 | ~$45 |
| EA Sports FC 26 | $69.99 | N/A (dropped) | N/A (dropped) | ~$52 |

- FC 24 blended at ~$57: Strong launch period at MSRP, discounted later; mix of current-gen ($70), last-gen ($60), Switch ($40).
- FC 25 blended at ~$45: Aggressive early discounting (50% off by November 2024, ~2 months post-launch); steepest discounts in franchise history.
- FC 26 blended at ~$52: Current-gen only ($70 MSRP) but already 50% off by Black Friday (3 months post-launch); no last-gen/Switch to dilute average.

## Key Caveats

1. **EA does not disclose unit sales.** All "copies sold" figures are estimates based on indirect evidence from Reddit. True figures could be ±30% from estimates.

2. **"Players" ≠ "Copies Sold."** EA's reported player counts include users who access via EA Play, Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, and free trials — not just purchasers.

3. **The FIFA/EA FC franchise's primary revenue driver is Ultimate Team microtransactions**, not copy sales. EA's concern about FC 25 "underperformance" was primarily about declining net bookings (heavily weighted toward microtransaction spending).

4. **The ~$1.40B total represents copy sales revenue only** for the 3 titles released 2023-2025. Including Ultimate Team microtransactions, the FC franchise likely generated several times this amount.

5. **FC 26 data is incomplete** (~5 months post-launch). The final lifetime estimate will likely be higher.

6. **The FIFA-to-FC rebrand** did not significantly impact initial sales for FC 24, but declining engagement across FC 25 and FC 26 suggests franchise fatigue may be accelerating.

7. **No FIFA-organization-branded traditional game shipped 2023–2025.** FIFA's blockchain/mobile titles and 2K partnership rumor did not produce a console/PC competitor. The Netflix/Delphi partnership (Dec 2025) has not yet produced a released game.

8. **Uncertainty range for total revenue: approximately $1.0B – $1.8B** (±30% from the $1.40B midpoint estimate).

9. **r/FIFA subreddit was inaccessible** during research (private/migrated to r/EASportsFC), potentially limiting available data.
