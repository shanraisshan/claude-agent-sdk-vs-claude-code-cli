## DETAILED REDDIT POST DATA

### POST 1: "EA lost $6 billion in market value, following FC 25 & Dragon Age underperformance news"
- **Post ID:** 1i8x6am
- **Subreddit:** r/Games
- **Author:** Turbostrider27
- **Score:** 1,958 | **Upvote Ratio:** 0.92 | **Comments:** 857
- **Date:** January 24, 2025
- **URL:** https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-lost-6-billion-in-market-value-following-fc-25-dragon-age-underperformance-news/
- **Permalink:** https://reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1i8x6am/
- **Key Comments (Iteration 1 + 2 combined):**
  - u/Cynical_onlooker (score 1151): "Honestly, the thing that surprises me most about this news was how realistic EA's expectations were for the sales. 3 million should be more than obtainable for a high budget AAA fantasy RPG nowadays."
  - u/Forestl (score 475): "Most of this is because of FC doing badly. They've made a shit ton of money from that game and it has helped them through other flops. To see those numbers going down is very bad"
  - u/FlukyS (score 187): "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual. Like the last 2 releases had the new anticheat that has been buggy as shit, they still are charging the full price even though they haven't added anything of value really in the last few releases and actually if anything they made stuff a bit worse on occasion. There really isn't any reason to buy their game and I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm excited to see what 2k do with the FIFA license."
  - u/orze (score 158): "Surprise the FIFA game is doing badly, don't know if it's the name change or FINALLY people got tired of it?"
  - u/[deleted] (score 17): "What's the consensus on FC25? was it a particularly bad release?"
  - u/froggyjm9 (score 75): "I had bought every fifa game since 1998, but didn't buy EA FC 24 and 25...all of my friends are too busy and we can't play it anymore, plus with getting older there's a huge disconnect between the era of players I grew up with."
- **Relevance:** CRITICAL -- Confirms FC 25 significantly underperformed expectations. EA had to slash fiscal year forecast. $6B market cap loss. The FC franchise weakness was the PRIMARY driver of the stock drop.

### POST 2: "Electronic Arts saw revenue fall to $1.88 billion in its third quarter"
- **Post ID:** 1ihva33
- **Subreddit:** r/Games
- **Author:** Turbostrider27
- **Score:** 261 | **Upvote Ratio:** 0.78 | **Comments:** 138
- **Date:** February 4, 2025
- **URL:** https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/electronics-arts-revenue-football-game-weakness-1236127266/
- **Title Quote:** "...due in part to weakness in sales for its football game EA Sports FC and Dragon Age game franchises."
- **Key Comments (Iteration 1 + 2 combined):**
  - u/Xenobrina (score 368): "Honestly really glad to see EA Sports FC in the headline unlike every other article that tries to pin it solely on Veilgaurd. EA sports losing money is a much more notable story anyway."
  - u/scorchedneurotic (score 168): "Only $1.88 billion? Going belly up any day now for sure." (sarcastic)
  - u/BatPixi (score 36): "Considering they are saving money on the fifa license this revenue could actually be positive for them."
  - u/Villag3Idiot (score 19): "Are people finally tired of EA's annual sports game rehash or is there some other reason?"
  - u/[deleted] (score 3): "I really dislike how these articles make as if these companies are losing money when in reality they are just not making as much in the same period on the last year."
- **Relevance:** CRITICAL -- EA Q3 FY2025 revenue fell from $1.94B to $1.88B (~3% decline YoY), directly citing weakness in FC franchise.

### POST 3: "Player count is now down 30% from FIFA23"
- **Post ID:** 18toyd1
- **Subreddit:** r/EASportsFC
- **Author:** wpisdu
- **Score:** 580 | **Upvote Ratio:** 0.91 | **Comments:** 252
- **Date:** December 29, 2023
- **Content:** Steam charts image showing EA FC 24 player count down ~30% compared to FIFA 23
- **Key Comments:**
  - (score 388): "Revenue is all that matters. Let's see what that report looks like." -- [deleted]
  - (score 311): "Please please PLEASE stop using Steam stats as indicative of an overall play base when a wildly overwhelming % of the player base is console and always will be." -- PercySledge
  - (score 165): "Those steam charts don't count all of the pc players on epic or directly from EA app which is more popular. There was a sizable increase in ultimate edition pre orders for fc 24 compared to 23." -- ARatOnPC
  - (score 47): Notes FIFA 23 had the World Cup which boosted player count -- HerrIggy
  - (score 7): "They had double-digit growth in new players and FUT revenue was up high-single digits YoY through the first four weeks of the launch" -- citing EA's November 2023 earnings call -- HelioFilter
  - (score 4): "The player base is dwindling. You can see it everywhere. Stream views are down. YouTube views are down... Huge black friday sales at $30 that is proof the game is not selling well." -- newmancrew
- **Relevance:** KEY DATA -- FC 24 Steam player count down ~30% from FIFA 23, but commenters debate whether Steam is representative of console-heavy player base. EA's own earnings call reported positive metrics.

- **Key Comments (Iteration 2):**
  - u/SparkyPantsMcGee (score 1516): "Everyone thinks it going to go to Konami. I think it's going to go to a bunch of no-name contract studios and the game will be for Mobile and be made dirt cheap."
  - u/[deleted] (score 2332): "Sounds like 'I'll make my own football game, with blackjack and hookers!' I mean, who even will buy the license if EA thought FIFA was too greedy for them?"
  - u/MadeByTango (score 605): "I mean, that's cool, but as long as EA has the teams and players names available through direct licensing then no one is going to care about FIFA proper. In fact, I give it less than five years before we get the headline, 'EA is proud to announce that the FIFA license has returned home to where it belongs' and for significantly cheaper than the $1bil/4 years being quoted right now."
  - u/[deleted] (score 177): "From PES 3-6, it was the GOAT. KONAMI was doing victory laps around EA Sports. Everyone knew if you wanted the best football, you played PES."
  - u/syrstorm (score 65): "if they're smart, they'll just buy PES. But they're not. They're arrogant and corrupt, so they'll try to build something from scratch in order to own it 100%... and they'll fail. EA has the teams, the players, the competitions (other than WC) and most importantly... the gameplay. FIFA has... 4 letters?"
- **Relevance:** Context on FIFA org's rival game plans. Prediction came true -- FIFA went with a lesser-known studio (Delphi via Netflix).

- **Relevance:** Confirms FIFA org's game plans were blockchain/mobile -- NOT a traditional console football game competitor.

  - u/PhriendlyPhantom (score 120): "They won't care because they still made a shit tonne of money"
  - u/XShadow11X (score 42): Detailed list of gameplay issues including: Tackling, Bounce Backs, L1 Speed Boost (broken), Passing, Dribbling = no skill, Manual Defending = useless, Technical Playstyle/R1 Dribbling, Aerial ability, Contextual Animation issues

- **Key Comments (Iteration 2):**
  - u/[deleted] (score 5895): "I genuinely don't think people realize since FIFA didn't renew the license, EA is contractually and legally obligated to do this. EA's legal fund is a drop in the ocean compared to how hard FIFA would come after them for not doing this."

- **Content:** Infographic of best-selling franchises (image post).
- **Key Comments (Iteration 2):**
  - u/thepotatoninja (score 271): "Feels weird tracking Fifa and not including EA Sports FC after they let the naming rights lapse. It's still the same studio, making the same game, but not paying a licence fee to have the FIFA name (who literally provide nothing else to the game)"
  - u/Angryfunnydog (score 528): "Jesus Minecraft being a single game sold almost the same as RE and FF franchises combined, what a fucking monster"

- **Key Comments (Iteration 2):**
  - u/SamShakusky71 (score 247): quoting article: "There are a few caveats. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was included in Xbox Game Pass, which means it's likely Call of Duty had a far higher player count than Battlefield 6. This GSD data is purely premium sales."
  - u/NikaroTheSwift (score 51): "Great, now they should have a little money to invest in BIGGER MAPS"
  - u/ZypherPunk (score 19): "Saudi's will be so happy"
  - u/DayChap (score 5): "It's a solid game, without the cringe and weirdo stuff COD has now. Not surprising it sold well."
- **Relevance:** BF6 beat FC 26 AND COD BO6 in European premium launch sales. Significant because FIFA/FC has historically dominated European game charts.

The shares dropped 7% in extended trading. For the fiscal third quarter, which ended Dec. 31, EA said it expects to report about $2.215 billion in net bookings, versus previous guidance of $2.4 billion to $2.55 billion. Revenue in the December quarter will be about $1.88 billion, with $1.11 in diluted earnings per share, the company said in a statement. EA said it expects net bookings for the full fiscal year, ending March 31, of between $7 billion and $7.15 billion, below previous guidance of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion. EA says net bookings include physical game sales as well as revenue from online games. The warning reveals weakness in the most prominent soccer video game franchise since 1993. It used to fall under the FIFA branding, but in 2022 EA's deal with FIFA ended and the last two EA soccer games have been sold [as EA Sports FC]."

- FIFA 23 was NOT the best-selling game in the US for 2023 -- that was Hogwarts Legacy (Posts 19 and 32).
- FIFA 23 had a World Cup boost (Qatar 2022 World Cup) that significantly inflated its player count (noted in Post 3 comments).
- **Contextual evidence**: FIFA 23 was the last game under the FIFA name. Its player count served as the benchmark against which EA FC 24 was compared (30% Steam decline noted in Post 3).
- Previous FIFA titles (FIFA 22, FIFA 23) were estimated by industry analysts at roughly 10-12+ million copies annually.

### EA Sports FC 25 (Released September 27, 2024)

**Copies Sold / Sales Data Found on Reddit:**
- **No specific total "X million copies sold" figure was found in any Reddit post for EA Sports FC 25.**
- However, **extensive data about underperformance** was documented across multiple subreddits.

1. **905,000 copies sold on PlayStation in June 2025** (Post 36) -- single month, single platform, driven by steep discount (9 months post-launch).
2. **FC 25 was discounted 50% within ~2 months of launch** (November 2024 per Post 21/PS5 comments).
3. **EA slashed full fiscal year forecast** due to FC 25 underperformance (Jason Schreier/Bloomberg, January 2025 -- Post 21).
4. **EA lost $6 billion in market value** (VGC, January 2025 -- Post 1).
5. **EA Q3 FY2025 net bookings: ~$2.215B** (below $2.4-2.55B guidance) -- Post 34.

11. **Steam average player count (January): approximately 53,000** (Post 23 comment).
12. **Community sentiment was extremely negative** -- described as "the worst FIFA/FC game ever" (Posts 7, 24, 39).

**Estimated Range:** ~7-12 million copies (lower than FC 24 due to poor retention and rapid discounting, though launch month was reportedly strong and it still topped all European charts).

### EA Sports FC 26 (Released ~September/October 2025)

**Copies Sold / Sales Data Found on Reddit:**

1. **Battlefield 6 beat FC 26 in European premium launch sales** (Post 12) -- historically unusual for an FC/FIFA game.
2. **Ghost of Yotei beat FC 26 in UK physical sales** (Post 13) -- though physical is ~10% of total sales.
3. **EA Q3 FY2026: FC net bookings increased "high single digits" YoY** (Post 23 comment) -- suggesting some recovery from FC 25 era.
4. **Total EA Q3 FY2026 net bookings were $3.046 billion, up 38% YoY** (Post 23 comment).
5. **Steam average player count (January): approximately 49,000** (Post 23 comment).

## IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **r/FIFA subreddit is inaccessible** -- returned "Cannot access r/FIFA - it may be private, quarantined, or doesn't exist" on all attempts in both iterations. This subreddit likely migrated to r/EASportsFC after the rebrand.

2. **No specific unit/copy sales figures were found on Reddit** for any of the three main titles (FIFA 23, EA FC 24, EA FC 25, EA FC 26). EA does not publicly disclose specific unit sales for individual FIFA/FC titles. Instead, they report total "net bookings" across the EA Sports FC franchise, which includes both copy sales revenue and microtransaction/Ultimate Team revenue combined.

3. **EA reports "players" not "copies sold"** -- EA consistently uses the metric of "players" or "accounts" rather than copies sold, which makes it impossible to distinguish between paid purchases, free trials (EA Play), and other access methods.

4. **Revenue data is franchise-level, not game-level** -- All EA financial disclosures found on Reddit report revenue at the franchise or division level, not per individual game title.

5. **Player counts and sales trends suggest:** FIFA 23 was a strong seller (World Cup boost, last FIFA-named game); EA FC 24 had a successful launch but mixed long-term engagement; EA FC 25 was a clear underperformer that caused significant financial damage to EA; FC 26 showed partial recovery in net bookings.

6. **No FIFA-organization-branded traditional game was released 2023-2025** -- The FIFA org announced blockchain/mobile titles and eventually partnered with Netflix/Delphi in December 2025, but no console/PC FIFA game shipped in this window.

7. **The FIFA/EA FC franchise dominates European game sales** -- Even a "disappointing" title like FC 25 was #1 in all 17 tracked European countries for H1 2025. The franchise is less dominant in the US market (where CoD and other titles lead).

8. **EA acquisition context** -- EA was acquired for $55 billion by PIF/Silver Lake/Affinity Partners in 2025, reflecting the massive value of the combined EA portfolio (EA FC, Madden, Battlefield, Apex Legends, The Sims, etc.).

9. **The only specific monthly copy count found was for FC 25:** 905,000 copies on PlayStation alone in June 2025 (Post 36), but this was 9 months post-launch and driven by a steep discount.
