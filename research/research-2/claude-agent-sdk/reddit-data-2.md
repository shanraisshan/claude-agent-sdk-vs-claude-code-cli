- **Permalink:** https://reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1i8x6am/
- **Key Comments (Iteration 1 + 2 combined):**
  - u/Cynical_onlooker (score 1147): "Honestly, the thing that surprises me most about this news was how realistic EA's expectations were for the sales. 3 million should be more than obtainable for a high budget AAA fantasy RPG nowadays."
  - u/Forestl (score 473): "Most of this is because of FC doing badly. They've made a shit ton of money from that game and it has helped them through other flops. To see those numbers going down is very bad"
  - u/FlukyS (score 194): "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual. Like the last 2 releases had the new anticheat that has been buggy as shit, they still are charging the full price even though they haven't added anything of value really in the last few releases and actually if anything they made stuff a bit worse on occasion. There really isn't any reason to buy their game and I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm excited to see what 2k do with the FIFA license."
  - u/orze (score 163): "Surprise the FIFA game is doing badly, don't know if it's the name change or FINALLY people got tired of it?"
  - u/[deleted] (score 18): "What's the consensus on FC25? was it a particularly bad release?"
  - u/froggyjm9 (score 73): "I had bought every fifa game since 1998, but didn't buy EA FC 24 and 25...all of my friends are too busy and we can't play it anymore, plus with getting older there's a huge disconnect between the era of players I grew up with."
- **Relevance:** CRITICAL -- Confirms FC 25 significantly underperformed expectations. EA had to slash fiscal year forecast. $6B market cap loss. The FC franchise weakness was the PRIMARY driver of the stock drop.

- **Key Comments (Iteration 1 + 2 combined):**
  - u/Xenobrina (score 366): "Honestly really glad to see EA Sports FC in the headline unlike every other article that tries to pin it solely on Veilgaurd. EA sports losing money is a much more notable story anyway."
  - u/scorchedneurotic (score 168): "Only $1.88 billion? Going belly up any day now for sure." (sarcastic)
  - u/BatPixi (score 37): "Considering they are saving money on the fifa license this revenue could actually be positive for them."
  - u/Villag3Idiot (score 17): "Are people finally tired of EA's annual sports game rehash or is there some other reason?"
  - u/[deleted] (score 2): "I really dislike how these articles make as if these companies are losing money when in reality they are just not making as much in the same period on the last year."
- **Relevance:** CRITICAL -- EA Q3 FY2025 revenue fell from $1.94B to $1.88B (~3% decline YoY), directly citing weakness in FC franchise.

- **Relevance:** KEY DATA -- FC 24 Steam player count down ~30% from FIFA 23, but commenters debate whether Steam is representative of console-heavy player base. EA's own earnings call reported positive metrics.

## PER-GAME SALES SUMMARY

### FIFA 23 (Released September 30, 2022)

**Copies Sold / Sales Data Found on Reddit:**
- **No specific total copy sales figure was found on Reddit** for FIFA 23.
- FIFA 23 was confirmed as the **#1 best-selling game on Steam** at its launch in September 2022 (Post 16).
- Hogwarts Legacy was described as "Europe's fastest-selling game (that isn't FIFA) for a generation" in March 2023, implying FIFA 23 held the top position for European launch sales in 2022-2023 (Post 14).
- FIFA 23 was NOT the best-selling game in the US for 2023 -- that was Hogwarts Legacy (Posts 19 and 32).
- FIFA 23 had a World Cup boost (Qatar 2022 World Cup) that significantly inflated its player count (noted in Post 3 comments).
- **Contextual evidence**: FIFA 23 was the last game under the FIFA name. Its player count served as the benchmark against which EA FC 24 was compared (30% Steam decline noted in Post 3).
- Previous FIFA titles (FIFA 22, FIFA 23) were estimated by industry analysts at roughly 10-12+ million copies annually.

**Sources:**
- r/pcgaming: "Cyberpunk 2077 Overtakes Modern Warfare 2, FIFA 23 As The Best Selling Game On Steam" (5520 score)
- r/Games: "Hogwarts Legacy is Europe's fastest-selling game (that isn't FIFA) for a generation" (5082 score)

3. **EA lost $6 billion in market value** (VGC, January 2025 -- Post 1).
4. **EA Q3 FY2025 revenue fell to $1.88B from $1.94B YoY**, citing FC weakness (Hollywood Reporter, February 2025 -- Post 2).
5. **Bloomberg confirmed "bookings slid on weakness in soccer"** (January 2025 -- Post 15).
6. **FC 25 was the worst user-rated game in franchise history** across Metacritic, Google, and Steam (Post 7).
7. **Despite underperformance, FC 25 was STILL #1 best-selling game in all 17 tracked European countries for H1 2025** per VGChartz data (Post 25).

9. **Community sentiment was extremely negative** -- described as "the worst FIFA/FC game ever" (Posts 7, 24).

**Estimated Range:** ~7-12 million copies (lower than FC 24 due to poor retention and rapid discounting, though launch month was reportedly strong).

---

### EA Sports FC 26 (Released ~September/October 2025)

**Copies Sold / Sales Data Found on Reddit:**
- **No specific "X million copies sold" figure was found for FC 26.**

7. **FC 26 was among top sellers during Europe's Black Friday** alongside Hogwarts Legacy (Post 22).

**Estimated Range:** Too early for definitive totals. Based on chart performance and financial recovery, likely comparable to or slightly above FC 25.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **r/FIFA subreddit is inaccessible** -- returned "Cannot access r/FIFA - it may be private, quarantined, or doesn't exist" on all attempts in both iterations. This subreddit likely migrated to r/EASportsFC after the rebrand.

2. **No specific unit/copy sales figures were found on Reddit** for any of the three main titles (FIFA 23, EA FC 24, EA FC 25, EA FC 26). EA does not publicly disclose specific unit sales for individual FIFA/FC titles. Instead, they report total "net bookings" across the EA Sports FC franchise, which includes both copy sales revenue and microtransaction/Ultimate Team revenue combined.

3. **EA reports "players" not "copies sold"** -- EA consistently uses the metric of "players" or "accounts" rather than copies sold, which makes it impossible to distinguish between paid purchases, free trials (EA Play), and other access methods.

4. **Revenue data is franchise-level, not game-level** -- All EA financial disclosures found on Reddit report revenue at the franchise or division level, not per individual game title.

5. **Player counts and sales trends suggest:** FIFA 23 was a strong seller (World Cup boost, last FIFA-named game); EA FC 24 had a successful launch but mixed long-term engagement; EA FC 25 was a clear underperformer that caused significant financial damage to EA; FC 26 showed partial recovery in net bookings.

6. **No FIFA-organization-branded traditional game was released 2023-2025** -- The FIFA org announced blockchain/mobile titles and a rumored 2K partnership, but no console/PC FIFA game shipped in this window.

7. **The FIFA/EA FC franchise dominates European game sales** -- Even a "disappointing" title like FC 25 was #1 in all 17 tracked European countries for H1 2025. The franchise is less dominant in the US market.

8. **EA acquisition context** -- EA was acquired for $55 billion by PIF/Silver Lake/Affinity Partners in 2025, reflecting the massive value of the combined EA portfolio (EA FC, Madden, Battlefield, Apex Legends, The Sims, etc.).
