## Games Identified in the 2023-2025 Range

Based on Reddit discussions, the FIFA/EA Sports FC franchise released the following titles in the 2023-2025 period:

1. **EA Sports FC 24** (September 29, 2023) - First game after the FIFA rebrand to EA Sports FC
2. **EA Sports FC 25** (September 27, 2024) - Second game under the EA Sports FC name
3. **EA Sports FC 26** (September/October 2025) - Third game under the EA Sports FC name

Note: **FIFA 23** (released September 2022) was the **last game** to carry the FIFA branding. EA lost the FIFA license and rebranded to EA Sports FC starting with FC 24. The FIFA organization announced plans to create a rival game with a different publisher (2K Games) but no FIFA-branded competitor was released during 2023-2025. Since FIFA 23 was released in September 2022, it falls outside the 2023-2025 window for release date but was actively sold during 2023.

- **Score:** 513
- **Date:** August 2024 (beta period)
- **Content:** "Played the oldies and the last four years releases. First time getting selected for beta and played it all evening today. Maybe I am overreacting given it is beta but my impression of beta is that the core gameplay portion should be there already. If I played the game without touching D-pad, I'd think it is just 24.
