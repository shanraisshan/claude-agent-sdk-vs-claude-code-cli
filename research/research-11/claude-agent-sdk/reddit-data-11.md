## Key Findings Summary

### What Reddit Data Confirmed:

1. **EA does not publicly disclose individual game unit sales** for the FIFA/EA Sports FC franchise. They report "players" (including trial/subscription users) and aggregate revenue figures. This is a deliberate strategy noted by multiple Reddit commenters.

2. **The only concrete player figure found**: EA Sports FC 24 had **14.5 million players** in its first month (Post #4, r/gamernews, November 2023). This is NOT a pure copy sales figure.

3. **Steam concurrent player peak data** (proxy for engagement trend):
   - FIFA 23: 110,757 (franchise peak on Steam)
   - EA FC 24: 107,109 (-3.3%)
   - EA FC 25: 108,534 (+1.3% on Steam, but reportedly lower on consoles)
   - EA FC 26: 95,489 (-12.0%)

4. **EA Sports FC 25 was a confirmed commercial disappointment**:
   - EA slashed fiscal year forecast (January 2025)
   - $6 billion market cap loss
   - EA Q3 FY2025 revenue decline ($1.88B vs $1.94B YoY)
   - EA never released player count / sales milestone for FC 25
   - Worst user-rated game in franchise history

5. **EA Sports FC 26 shows continued decline**:
   - 12% drop in Steam peak engagement vs FC 25
   - Outsold by other titles (Ghost of Yotei, Battlefield 6) at launch
   - Discounted 50% within 3 months of release

6. **The FIFA/EA Sports FC franchise has sold over 325 million copies lifetime** across all titles since 1993, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises ever (confirmed via franchise ranking discussions).

7. **The franchise's popularity peaked with FIFA 23** (last FIFA-branded game) and has been on a downward trend since the rebrand to EA Sports FC (confirmed by community member in Post #14).

### Data Limitations:
- EA does not publish per-title unit sales for FIFA/FC
- "Players" figures include EA Play trial users, subscriptions, and free access methods
- Steam data represents only a fraction of total sales (console sales, especially PlayStation, dominate)
- European chart data provides relative rankings but not absolute unit numbers
- Reddit discussions are qualitative ("it underperformed") rather than quantitative
- No VGChartz or NPD unit sales data specific to FIFA/FC was found in Reddit posts
