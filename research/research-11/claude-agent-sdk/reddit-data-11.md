### Post 5: UK Physical Sales Down 30% for FC 24 vs FIFA 23
- **Title**: "UK physical sales for EA FC are down 30% compared to FIFA 23"
- **Author**: F0REM4N | **Score**: 460 | **Upvote Ratio**: 0.91 | **Comments**: 166
- **Subreddit**: r/XboxSeriesX | **ID**: 16xtqme
- **Date**: October 2, 2023
- **URL**: videogameschronicle.com
- **Key Comments**:
  - u/irJess (score 221): "I work at Tesco, we have actually stopped physical game sales in the last year. I'm sure the name change does contribute but I do believe a large amount would have bought digital this year."
  - u/mocoworm (score 201): "But what are the overall sales? I would expect physical to be down YoY as that media is declining. Are the total sales figures down by 30%, or was there a 30% increase in digital?"
  - u/NotFromMilkyWay (score 2): **"Just for numbers sake: EA is 80% digital across console platforms according to their financial reports. Digital growth is around 5 percentage points per year. So if last year they sold 20% of FIFA physically that means they sold 15% this year. Just from that effect alone it would be expected for physical sales to be 25% less than last year. It's at 30% instead. So it sells pretty well. I doubt 5% of physical copies equal the 400 million per year FIFA demanded."**
  - u/Bashemgud33 (score 42): "Most people have no idea the it's the same game but the name changed because the FIFA deal fell through."
  - u/thetantalus (score 14): "Also, don't forget that EA doesn't have to pay FIFA anymore, so even if they're down 30% they may still be net positive."
  - u/SirBulbasaur13 (score 24): "These physical stats don't really mean a lot without accompanying data in regards to digital sales"
- **SALES DATA**: UK physical sales for EA Sports FC 24 were down 30% compared to FIFA 23 at launch. Key context: EA is 80% digital, so the 30% physical decline translates to a much smaller overall decline.

## PER-GAME COPY SALES SUMMARY

### EA Sports FC 24 (Released: September 29, 2023)

**Copy Sales Data Found on Reddit:**
| Data Point | Source | Confidence |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| UK physical sales down 30% vs FIFA 23 at launch | Post #5 (r/XboxSeriesX) | HIGH |
| EA is 80% digital across console platforms | Post #5 comment | MEDIUM |
| Overall sales described as "pretty well" despite physical decline | Post #5 comment (analysis) | LOW |
| Among top console engagement titles (CoD, GTA, Roblox tier) | Post #7 (r/gaming) | MEDIUM |
| Previously found: 14.5 million players in first month (from prior research iteration -- r/gamernews post 17mq3a1) | Prior research | HIGH |
| "Players" includes EA Play trial users -- NOT pure copy sales | Post comment context | HIGH |

**Total Copies Sold**: **No exact copies-sold figure found on Reddit.** The 14.5 million "players" figure (from prior research) is the closest metric but includes non-purchasers. EA does not disclose per-title unit sales.

**Estimated range**: ~10-12 million copies based on the 14.5M players figure adjusted for trial/subscription users, and the franchise's historical baseline.
**Confidence Level**: LOW-MEDIUM

### EA Sports FC 25 (Released: September 27, 2024)

**Copy Sales Data Found on Reddit:**
| Data Point | Source | Confidence |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| EA slashed fiscal year forecast due to FC 25 underperformance | Posts #8, #9 (r/PS5, r/pcgaming) | HIGH |
| EA lost $6 billion in market cap, primarily due to FC 25 | Post #10 (r/Games) | HIGH |
| EA Q3 FY25 revenue fell from $1.94B to $1.88B | Post #11 (r/Games) | HIGH |
| FC 25 was #1 best-selling game in Germany 2024 (units, phys+digital) | Post #15 (r/gaming) | HIGH |
| Worst user-rated game in franchise history (Metacritic, Google, Steam) | Post #12 (r/EASportsFC) | HIGH |
| Half-price within ~7 weeks of launch | Post #8 comment | HIGH |
| "FC 25 underperforming is way more of an issue for EA than dragon age" | Post #9 comment | MEDIUM |
| "Most of this is because of FC doing badly" | Post #10 comment (score 474) | MEDIUM |
| "Microtransactions still give them billions every year" | Post #12 comment | LOW |
| EA never released official player count/sales milestone for FC 25 | Community observation | MEDIUM |

**Total Copies Sold**: **No exact figure found on Reddit.** EA notably did NOT release any player count or sales milestone for FC 25 (unlike the 14.5M figure for FC 24), strongly suggesting disappointing numbers. Despite underperformance, FC 25 was still #1 in Germany and dominant in Europe.

**Estimated range**: ~8-10 million copies based on confirmed underperformance, revenue decline, and absence of any official sales announcement.
**Confidence Level**: LOW

### EA Sports FC 26 (Released: September 2025)

**Copy Sales Data Found on Reddit:**
| Data Point | Source | Confidence |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Outsold by Ghost of Yotei in UK physical sales at launch | Post #13 (r/gaming) | HIGH |
| European launch sales beaten by Battlefield 6 (GSD premium data) | Post #14 (r/gaming) | HIGH |
| BF6 sold 6.5M copies globally in first days (benchmark comparison) | Related post (r/gaming) | HIGH |
| 50% off during Black Friday 2025 (<3 months from release) | Reddit comment context | HIGH |
| "Beating Fifa on sales in the UK is some feat" -- implies historically rare | Post #13 comment (score 809) | MEDIUM |
| Community reception extremely negative (worst in franchise history continued) | Post #22 (r/EASportsFC) | MEDIUM |

**Total Copies Sold**: **No exact figure found on Reddit.** The game is ~5 months old as of the research date. Being outsold by other titles at European launch (unprecedented) and rapid discounting suggest this is the weakest-selling FC/FIFA entry in recent history.

**Estimated range**: Likely below FC 25 levels. Possibly 7-9 million copies, though highly speculative.
**Confidence Level**: VERY LOW

- Active throughout 2023-2025
- Community sentiment indicates declining engagement

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. EA Does Not Disclose Per-Title Unit Sales
EA reports "active players" (including trial/subscription users) and aggregate revenue/net bookings rather than copies sold. This is a deliberate corporate strategy noted by multiple Reddit commenters. No specific copies-sold figure for any EA Sports FC title (FC 24, FC 25, or FC 26) was found on Reddit.

### 2. Confirmed Declining Sales Trend
Multiple Reddit posts and comments confirm:
- FC 24 sold fewer copies than FIFA 23 (UK physical data + community analysis)
- FC 25 sold fewer copies than FC 24 (explicit confirmation from industry data discussions)
- FC 26 appears to be selling fewer than FC 25 (being outsold at launch, rapid discounting)

### 3. FC 25 Was a Major Commercial Disappointment
Despite being #1 in Germany and dominant in Europe, FC 25 underperformed EA's internal targets enough to cause:
- Fiscal year forecast revision
- $6 billion market cap loss
- EA Q3 revenue decline

### 4. FC 26 Shows Steepest Decline
- First time losing to non-FIFA/CoD titles at UK/European launch
- No official sales press release from EA (first time ever)
- 50% discount within 3 months of release

### 5. The Franchise Remains Dominant Despite Decline
Even in decline, EA Sports FC games remain among the best-selling titles in Europe. The franchise's floor is still enormous by industry standards. FIFA/FC is consistently in the top tier alongside CoD as the biggest annual game launches.

### 6. Franchise Lifetime Sales
FIFA franchise listed among best-selling game franchises of all time with 325+ million copies across all titles since 1993. Community notes EA Sports FC should be counted as continuation of the same franchise.
