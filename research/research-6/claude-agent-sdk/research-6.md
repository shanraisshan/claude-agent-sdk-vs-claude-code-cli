# Research Report: FIFA / EA Sports FC Copy Sales & Revenue (2023–2025)
## Iteration 6 — Claude Agent SDK

---

## Executive Summary

Three premium FIFA/EA Sports FC titles were actively sold during 2023–2025: **FIFA 23** (released Sept 2022, active through Sept 2023), **EA Sports FC 24** (released Sept 2023, active through Sept 2024), and **EA Sports FC 25** (released Sept 2024, active through 2025). EA does not publicly disclose exact unit sales. Estimates below are derived from EA's reported "player" counts (adjusted by 75–80% purchaser ratio), GSD European retail tracking comparisons, chart performance data, and EA earnings commentary sourced from 21 Reddit posts across 22 search queries.

**Total estimated copy-sale revenue: $3.18 billion across 48 million copies.**

## Methodology

EA does not publicly disclose unit (copy) sales for FIFA/EA Sports FC titles. They report "players" — a deliberately inflated metric that includes EA Play subscribers, Xbox Game Pass users, PS Plus trial recipients, and free weekend participants. No Reddit post in any of the 22 searches conducted contained a verified "X million copies sold" figure for any title in scope.

**Estimation approach:**
1. Applied the **75–80% purchaser ratio** (midpoint 78%) to EA's reported "player" counts per research rules.
2. Used **European GSD** (Games Sales Data) retail tracking for relative year-over-year comparisons: FC 24 was ~10% below FIFA 23 at launch; FC 25 was ~5% below FC 24.
3. Cross-referenced **Steam peak concurrent data**, **chart positions** (Circana/NPD US, GSD Europe, UK boxed), and **EA earnings call commentary**.
4. Applied a **first-month-to-lifetime multiplier of ~1.4x** for annual sports titles that are replaced after 12 months (accounting for holiday sales, football tournament boosts, and long-tail purchases).
5. For FC 25, applied the **"lower end" rule** given EA slashed its fiscal year forecast, lost $6B in market value, and the game was described as an underperformer.
6. **Pricing:** $60 for FIFA 23 (released Sept 2022, pre-$70 standard); $70 for FC 24 and FC 25 (2023+ titles on current-gen consoles at $70 MSRP).

## A. Revenue Table

Revenue = copies sold × average retail price. **Only** physical + digital copy sales. No microtransactions, DLC, loot boxes, Ultimate Team packs, or in-app purchases.

| # | Title | Year | Copies Sold | Avg Price | Revenue (USD) | Confidence |
|---|-------|------|-------------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | FIFA 23 | 2022 (active 2023) | 18.0M | $60 | $1,080,000,000 | Medium |
| 2 | EA Sports FC 24 | 2023 | 16.0M | $70 | $1,120,000,000 | Medium |
| 3 | EA Sports FC 25 | 2024 | 14.0M | $70 | $980,000,000 | Low |
| | **TOTAL** | | **48.0M** | | **$3.18B** | |

### Per-Title Estimation Rationale

#### FIFA 23 — 18.0 million copies ($1.08B) | Confidence: Medium

- **Franchise peak**, boosted by the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar (Nov–Dec 2022) which extended sales deep into 2023.
- EA reported ~10.3M "players" in the first week at launch. At 78% purchaser ratio → ~8.0M first-week buyers.
- **Highest Steam all-time peak in franchise history:** 110,757 concurrent (Jan 2023).
- FC 24's European launch was **~10% below FIFA 23** (GSD data), establishing FIFA 23 as the high-water mark. Reverse-calculating from FC 24's ~16M estimate: 16M / 0.90 ≈ 17.8M, rounded to 18M.
- **Top 5 US best-selling game for H1 2023** per Circana/NPD data despite being a Sept 2022 release (r/gaming, score 15,894).
- Hogwarts Legacy was described as "Europe's fastest-selling game that isn't FIFA for a generation" — confirming FIFA 23's dominance as the European benchmark.
- Elden Ring's achievement was qualified as "biggest non-FIFA or Call of Duty launch since RDR2" — further confirming FIFA 23's sales supremacy.
- FIFA 23 servers shut down Sept 2023 when FC 24 launched.
- **Confidence: Medium** — no direct copy figure; estimate derived from reverse-calculation against FC 24's GSD-anchored estimate, player counts with purchaser ratio, and franchise-peak status with World Cup tailwind.

#### EA Sports FC 24 — 16.0 million copies ($1.12B) | Confidence: Medium

- First title under the "EA Sports FC" rebrand; all legacy FIFA titles delisted from digital storefronts at launch.
- **EA reported 11.3M "players" first week and 14.5M "active players" first month** (includes EA Play, Game Pass, trial users).
- At **78% purchaser ratio:** ~8.8M first-week buyers, ~11.3M first-month buyers.
- Applying **1.4x first-month-to-lifetime multiplier** (accounting for Euro 2024 boost, holiday sales, long tail): 11.3M × 1.4 ≈ 15.8M → rounded to **16M**.
- European launch was **~10% below FIFA 23** per GSD data — considered "not bad at all given the complete name change."
- EA's Nov 2023 earnings call claimed **double-digit growth in new players** and **FUT revenue up high-single digits YoY** through first 4 weeks (earnings-positive despite unit decline).
- **Topped UK charts in June 2024** (9 months post-launch) during Euro 2024.
- **#1 best-selling game in Germany for full year 2024** (physical + digital).
- Added to **PS Plus Essential May 2024** (only 7 months post-launch — earlier than typical, inflating subsequent "player" counts but not copy sales).
- Steam all-time peak: 107,109 (-3.3% vs FIFA 23).
- Reddit commenter noted: "sizable increase in ultimate edition pre orders for fc 24 compared to 23" — suggesting strong early adoption despite overall decline.
- **Confidence: Medium** — strongest data foundation of the three titles; anchored by EA's reported player milestones (with purchaser ratio adjustment), GSD European comparison, and chart dominance across multiple markets.

#### EA Sports FC 25 — 14.0 million copies ($0.98B) | Confidence: Low

- Officially described as an **underperformer** by EA; contributed to **$6B market cap loss** (Jan 2025) and **fiscal year forecast slash** (Jason Schreier report via Bloomberg).
- European GSD data showed **~5% fewer copies than FC 24** at comparable point. From FC 24's ~16M: 16M × 0.95 = ~15.2M before lower-end adjustment.
- **Lower-end adjustment applied:** EA slashed forecasts, lost $6B market value, and the game was universally panned. Per rules, "underperforming" titles with slashed forecasts use the lower end. Adjusted to **14M** (reflecting that global decline likely exceeded the European 5% GSD figure, consistent with EA's severe financial warnings).
- **Worst user-rated game in franchise history** across Metacritic, Google, and Steam.
- EA notably **did not issue any player milestone press release** for FC 25 (unlike FC 24's 11.3M/14.5M announcements) — the silence itself is a strong negative signal.
- **EA Q3 FY2025 revenue fell to $1.88B vs $1.94B YoY**, with FC and Dragon Age cited as primary causes.
- Despite "underperformance," was still **#1 best-selling game in all 17 tracked European countries for H1 2025** (VGChartz/GSD, July 2025) — underperformance was relative to EA's internal projections, not the broader market.
- Steam all-time peak: 108,534 (+1.3% vs FC 24) — initial interest didn't crater, but retention/engagement declined sharply.
- Reddit comments: "People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore" — issue was both lower copy sales AND lower Ultimate Team spending.
- **Confidence: Low** — EA withheld milestone data; GSD covers Europe only; "underperformance" language and the severity of EA's financial response suggest a broader-than-5% global decline.

---

### Pricing Notes

- **$60** used for FIFA 23 (released Sept 2022, before the 2023+ $70 standard; $60 was the standard cross-gen price point).
- **$70** used for FC 24 and FC 25 (released 2023+; primary sales volume on PS5/Xbox Series X at $70 MSRP).
- FIFA Mobile / EA Sports FC Mobile are **excluded** as free-to-play titles with no copy sales.
- Nintendo Switch "Legacy Edition" (~$40) represents a small fraction of total sales and is absorbed into the blended average.

**Note:** Steam is a minority platform for FIFA/FC. Console (PS5, PS4, Xbox) represents the overwhelming majority of sales. Multiple Reddit commenters cautioned: "Please PLEASE stop using Steam stats as indicative of an overall play base."

## E. Limitations and Caveats

1. **No exact unit sales disclosed by EA.** All copy-sold figures are estimates. EA deliberately reports "players" (inflated with EA Play, Game Pass, PS Plus, trial users) rather than copies sold.
2. **GSD data is European-only.** The 10% and 5% relative decline figures are from European retail tracking. Global patterns may differ, though Europe is the franchise's dominant market (FIFA/FC outsells all other franchises in Europe by a wide margin).
3. **Purchaser ratio is an approximation.** The 75–80% rule for converting "players" to purchasers is a heuristic. The actual ratio depends on EA Play subscriber engagement, Game Pass trial rates, and regional factors.
4. **Lifetime multiplier uncertainty.** The 1.4x first-month-to-lifetime ratio for annual sports titles is an industry approximation. Individual titles may vary based on tournament timing (World Cup, Euros), holiday positioning, and competitive landscape.
5. **Revenue is copy sales ONLY.** EA Sports FC generates substantial additional revenue from Ultimate Team microtransactions (estimated $1.5–2B+ annually across the franchise). This is explicitly excluded from this analysis.
6. **FC 25's "underperformance" was relative to EA's internal projections.** FC 25 was still the #1 game in all 17 European countries for H1 2025. The financial impact was EA missing its own targets, not catastrophic absolute sales failure.
