- **Key Comments:**
  - (score 1,151): "Honestly, the thing that surprises me most about this news was how realistic EA's expectations were for the sales. 3 million should be more than obtainable for a high budget AAA fantasy RPG nowadays."
  - (score 473): "Most of this is because of FC doing badly. They've made a shit ton of money from that game and it has helped them through other flops. To see those numbers going down is very bad"
  - (score 189): "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual. Like the last 2 releases had the new anticheat that has been buggy as shit..."
  - (score 160): "Surprise the FIFA game is doing badly, don't know if it's the name change or FINALLY people got tired of it?"
  - (score 80): "I had bought every fifa game since 1998, but didn't buy EA FC 24 and 25... all of my friends are too busy and we can't play it anymore"

- **Key Data Points:**
  - EA slashed fiscal year forecast due to FC 25 and Dragon Age underperformance
  - Dragon Age: The Veilguard reached only ~1.5 million players, missing expectations by nearly 50%
- **Key Comments:**
  - (score 250): "EA always had big internal expectations so a fact they only forecasted 3 million 'players' during initial sales window for AAA Dragon Age RPG... game still didnt met those... Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription..."
  - (score 16): "EA FC25 underperforming is way more of an issue for EA then dragon age. People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore."

  - Weakness specifically attributed to EA Sports FC and Dragon Age franchises
- **Key Comments:**
  - (score 369): "Honestly really glad to see EA Sports FC in the headline unlike every other article that tries to pin it solely on Veilguard. EA sports losing money is a much more notable story anyway."
  - (score 166): "Only $1.88 billion? Going belly up any day now for sure." (sarcastic)
  - (score 36): "Considering they are saving money on the fifa license this revenue could actually be positive for them."

- **Content:** "Upon the release of EA SPORTS FC 24, EA wasted no time in hyping the game's success. EA has revealed details of fan engagement within the EA SPORTS FC ecosystem, revealing that more than 11.3 million players were engaged in EA SPORTS FC 24 globally, including on EA Play, in the first week... Now, EA is following up..."
- **CRITICAL NOTE:** EA reported 11.3 million "players" in the first week and 14.5 million "active players" in the first month. These are PLAYER counts, NOT copies sold. EA Play, Game Pass, and trial users are included in these figures.

### POST 5: Player count is now down 30% from FIFA23

- **Author:** wpisdu

- **Content:** Image showing Steam player count charts comparing FIFA 23 and FC 24
- **Key Comments:**
  - (score 388): "Revenue is all that matters. Let's see what that report looks like."
  - (score 308): "Please please PLEASE stop using Steam stats as indicative of an overall play base when a wildly overwhelming % of the player base is console and always will be."
  - (score 163): "Those steam charts don't count all of the pc players on epic or directly from EA app which is more popular. There was a sizable increase in ultimate edition pre orders for fc 24 compared to 23."
  - (score 43): "This graphic seems to be neglecting the fact that there was a small competition around this time last year that could have increased hype and player count for a few months... the World Cup."
  - (score 10): "You could get a much more accurate story by reading the transcript from their November earnings call. They had double-digit growth in new players and FUT revenue was up high-single digits YoY through the first four weeks of the launch."
  - (score 42): "...on Steam. That's like saying a famous chain restaurant is clearly in trouble because one of their minor branches sales have gone down, even though all their other branches have people smashing their windows in desperate to eat there."
- **Sales data context:** Steam-only player counts showed ~30% decline from FIFA 23 to FC 24. However, EA's own earnings call claimed double-digit growth in new players and FUT revenue up high-single digits YoY in first 4 weeks.

- **Key Comments:**
  - (score 813): "Beating Fifa on sales in the UK is some feat"
  - (score 282): "This is pointless, physical sales are tiny now... Almost 90% of games sold in UK in 2022 were digital"
  - (score 25): "Still, even for physical beating EAFC is quite impressive. I expect a lot of the casual sports only gamers still buy physical."
  - (score 26): "Physical only, be more interested to see total sales."

- **Score:** 892 | **Comments:** 60
- **Date:** October 2025
- **Source:** TheGameBusiness
- **Permalink:** https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1o9atzm/
- **Key Comment (score 246):** "There are a few caveats. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was included in Xbox Game Pass, which means it's likely Call of Duty had a far higher player count than Battlefield 6. This GSD data is purely premium sales."
- **Note:** FC 26 falls outside the 2023-2025 research window. BF6 outselling FC 26 at European launch is unprecedented and shows the declining trajectory of FC copy sales.

- **Content:** Screenshots from Metacritic, Google Audience Rating, and Steam showing FC 25 with lowest user ratings in franchise history.
- **Key Comments:**

  - (score 117): "They won't care because they still made a shit tonne of money"
  - (score 44): Detailed list of gameplay issues: tackling, bounce backs, speed boost exploits, passing, dribbling, manual defending
  - (score 7): "I think the numbers EA get from the game are too high compared to the quality of their product. Microtransactions still give them billions every year."

- **Content:** Comprehensive analysis showing Steam player counts, Twitch viewership, and YouTube engagement all declining from FIFA 23 era to FC 26.
- **Key Comment with EA Q3 FY26 earnings data (score 14):** "EA SPORTS FC net bookings increased high single digits year-over-year in Q3, excluding the benefit of deluxe edition content timing, driven by strength in Ultimate Team and FC Mobile."
- **Key Comment (score 14):** "Now show the only data that matters... income generated. This is all irrelevant as the people who stick around spend more and more money."
- **Sales data context:** Despite player engagement declining, EA reported FC net bookings up high single digits YoY in Q3 FY26. This suggests copy sales are declining but microtransaction revenue from remaining players compensates.

- **Source:** steamcharts.com
- **Key Comment (score 1):** "Engagement was down from the off due to lower sales. This is the first year they've never put out an official press release and even last years they had to redact/change because it made the game look bad. Popularity peaked in fifa 23 and has been on a downward trend since. It lost percentiles with the name change and further percentiles into 25."
- **Key Comment (score 5):** "I'm surprised all time peak is lower this year since almost everyone seems to say PC is a lot better for gameplay compared to console. Makes me think console has definitely dropped more than 12%"

## Per-Game Sales Data Summary

---

### FIFA 23 (Released September 30, 2022 -- Active through 2023)

**Copies Sold / Player Count Data Found on Reddit:**

- **No explicit total copies sold figure found on Reddit for FIFA 23**
- FIFA 23 appeared in the top 5 US best-selling games for H1 2023 per Circana/NPD data (Post 16, r/gaming, score 15,894)
- FIFA 23 was described as the benchmark: "Hogwarts Legacy is Europe's fastest-selling game (that isn't FIFA) for a generation" (Post 17, r/Games, score 5,085)
- "Elden Ring is the biggest non-FIFA or Call of Duty launch since RDR2" confirms FIFA's perennial dominance (Post 18, r/Games, score 13,910)
- EA FC 24's European launch was "approximately 10% down on FIFA 23" (from previous iteration's Post 4, r/pcgaming comment citing VGC/GSD data) -- making FIFA 23 the high-water mark
- The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar (Nov-Dec 2022) massively boosted FIFA 23 engagement and sales into 2023 (referenced across multiple posts)
- Steam all-time peak: **110,757 concurrent players** (Jan 2023) -- highest in franchise Steam history (Post 11)
- FIFA 23 servers shut down September 2023 when FC 24 launched
- EA previously reported "10.3 million players in FIFA 23's first week" at launch in Sept 2022 (referenced in multiple Reddit discussions). IMPORTANT: "players" != copies sold.
- Hogwarts Legacy ended up as the #1 best-selling game of 2023 in the US, meaning FIFA 23 was not #1 for full-year 2023 in the US market (but it was released Sept 2022, not 2023)

**Estimated Sales Context from Reddit Discussions:**
- EA historically does not disclose unit sales for individual titles; they report "players" and "net bookings" instead
- FIFA titles typically sell 20-30+ million copies over their lifecycle based on franchise trajectory data discussed on Reddit
- One r/pcgaming comment from previous iteration noted FC 24 launch was "10% down on FIFA 23" in Europe, implying FIFA 23's European launch was the franchise peak -- and that FC 24 was "probably doing better than FIFA 22 and probably a lot of other previous entries"
- The World Cup boost was frequently cited as a unique tailwind for FIFA 23 that subsequent titles would not have

### EA Sports FC 24 (Released September 29, 2023 -- Active through 2024)

**Copies Sold / Player Count Data Found on Reddit:**

- **EA reported 11.3 million "players" in the first week** (Post 4, r/M8X_GAMENEWS). CRITICAL: "players" includes EA Play, Game Pass trials, etc. -- NOT copies sold.
- **EA reported 14.5 million "active players" in the first month** (same post)
- **European launch sales were approximately 10% below FIFA 23** (from previous iteration's Post 4, r/pcgaming comment citing VGC/GSD data)
- EA's November 2023 earnings call claimed **"double-digit growth in new players and FUT revenue was up high-single digits YoY"** through first 4 weeks vs FIFA 23 launch (referenced in Post 5 comment, score 10)
- Steam player count was **down ~30% from FIFA 23** on Steam specifically (Post 5, r/EASportsFC, score 585). However, commenters noted Steam is a minority platform.
- Steam all-time peak: **107,109** (Jan 2024), down 3.3% from FIFA 23's peak (Post 11)
- FC 24 **topped UK charts in June 2024** during Euro 2024 (Post 14, r/Games, score 273), showing strong sustained sales
- FC 24 was **added to PS Plus Essential in May 2024** -- only 7 months after launch (Post 15), inflating subsequent "player" counts
- One comment noted: "There was a sizable increase in ultimate edition pre orders for fc 24 compared to 23" (Post 5, score 163)
- Comment from r/pcgaming (previous iteration): "10% down on Fifa 23 is honestly not bad at all given the complete name change. And Fifa 23 itself was an absolute monster so EA FC 24 is probably doing better than FIFA 22"

**Key Financial Context:**
- FC 24 was the #1 selling game in Europe in September 2023 (launch month)
- FC 24 was the #1 best-selling game in Germany for 2024 (physical + digital) per German sales charts
- EA reported double-digit growth in new FC 24 players vs FIFA 23 at earnings call -- but this likely includes EA Play trial users

### EA Sports FC 25 (Released September 27, 2024 -- Active through 2025)

**Copies Sold / Player Count Data Found on Reddit:**

- **EA Sports FC 25 sold approximately 5% fewer copies than EA Sports FC 24 according to GSD (European retail tracking) data** (from previous iteration's Post 7, r/gaming comment: "Based on GSD data, EA Sports FC 25 sold just 5% less than EA Sports FC 24. Which means that problem isn't in 'people rejected our game' but more about 'we have way too high expectations.'")
- **EA officially described FC 25 as an underperformer** that caused them to slash their full fiscal year forecast (Post 2, Jason Schreier report, Jan 2025)
- **EA lost $6 billion in market value** following the FC 25 and Dragon Age underperformance announcement (Post 1, r/Games, Jan 2025)
- **EA Q3 FY2025 revenue fell to $1.88B vs $1.94B** year-earlier, with FC and Dragon Age cited as causes (Post 3, r/Games, Feb 2025)
- FC 25 was **the worst user-rated game in franchise history** across Metacritic, Google, and Steam (Post 9, r/EASportsFC, score 622)
- Steam all-time peak: **108,534** (Jan 2025), up 1.3% vs FC 24 (Post 11) -- slight increase suggests initial launch was not dramatically different, but engagement/retention cratered
- FC 25 was the **#1 best-selling game in Europe for H1 2025**, appearing in all 17 tracked countries (Post 6, r/Games, VGChartz, July 2025)
- **EA never issued a press release trumpeting player milestones** for FC 25, unlike FC 24's 11.3M/14.5M announcements -- a telling omission (Post 11 comment)
- The issue was described as both lower copy sales AND lower Ultimate Team (FUT) microtransaction spending: "People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore" (Post 2 comment, score 16)
- EA Q3 FY26 (which covers FC 26's first months) later reported "EA SPORTS FC net bookings increased high single digits year-over-year" -- suggesting partial recovery in the franchise's total revenue (Post 10 comment)

**Key Financial Context:**
- EA saved on the FIFA licensing fee (~$150M/year reportedly) but this was offset by lower sales
- FC 25 still outsold every other game in Europe for H1 2025 despite the "underperformance" narrative
- The underperformance was measured against EA's internal expectations and financial projections, not against the broader market

## Additional Context from Reddit

### EA's "Players" vs Copies Sold
Multiple Reddit comments across posts highlight the critical distinction:
- EA reports "players" not "copies sold" -- this is a deliberate corporate choice
- "Players" includes: EA Play subscribers who get trial access, Xbox Game Pass users, PS Plus recipients (FC 24 added May 2024), free weekend players, GeForce Now subscribers
- One r/pcgaming commenter (score 250): "Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription..."
- EA has not publicly disclosed unit copy sales for any FIFA/FC title in recent years
- This means EA's reported figures (e.g., 11.3M players first week for FC 24) significantly overstate the number of actual game purchases

### EA Revenue Context
- EA Q3 FY25 (Oct-Dec 2024): Revenue $1.88B, down from $1.94B YoY
- EA total quarterly revenue: "almost 2 billion" per user referencing official EA report
- EA SPORTS FC net bookings in FY26 Q3: "increased high single digits year-over-year" despite declining player engagement on Steam
- EA was acquired by PIF/Silver Lake/Affinity Partners for $55 billion (r/EASportsFC, June 2025)
- The franchise's revenue comes from both base game sales (copies sold) and Ultimate Team microtransactions (NOT in scope for this research)

### FIFA/FC Sales Dominance in Europe
- FIFA/FC is the perennial benchmark for European game sales. Other games are measured as "non-FIFA, non-CoD"
- "Hogwarts Legacy is Europe's fastest-selling game (that isn't FIFA) for a generation" (2023)
- "Elden Ring is the biggest non-FIFA or Call of Duty launch since RDR2" (2022)
- FC 25 maintaining #1 in all 17 tracked European countries for H1 2025 despite "underperformance" shows the franchise's massive baseline
- FC 24 topped UK charts as late as June 2024, 9 months post-launch

### Name Change Impact
- The rebrand from "FIFA" to "EA Sports FC" caused measurable sales friction
- A 10% decline at FC 24 launch was considered "not bad at all given the complete name change"
- Steam data shows FC 24 slightly underperformed FIFA 23 in peak concurrent players (-3.3%)
- EA delisted all older FIFA titles from Steam concurrent with FC 24 launch
- Comment: "10% down on FIFA 23 is honestly not bad at all given the complete name change. And FIFA 23 itself was an absolute monster so EA FC 24 is probably doing better than FIFA 22"

### Platform Distribution
- Console (PS5, PS4, Xbox) represents the overwhelming majority of FIFA/FC sales
- Steam data is indicative but not representative -- many PC players use EA App instead
- FIFA/FC's core demographic is casual console gamers who may not be active on Steam
- "Please please PLEASE stop using Steam stats as indicative of an overall play base when a wildly overwhelming % of the player base is console and always will be." (Post 5 comment, score 308)

### Steam Peak Concurrent Player Data (Full Table from Post 11)

| Game | All-Time Peak | Date | YoY Change |
|------|--------------|------|------------|
| FIFA 22 | 108,168 | May 2022 | -- |

## Critical Finding

**EA does not publicly disclose copies sold for FIFA/EA FC titles.** Reddit discussions reference "players" (which EA inflates with EA Play, Game Pass, PS Plus, and trial users). No Reddit post in any search results contained a specific, verified "X million copies sold" figure for any of the three titles in scope.

The closest quantitative proxy data available from Reddit:
1. **Relative comparisons:** FC 24 ~10% below FIFA 23 launch in Europe; FC 25 ~5% below FC 24 (GSD data)
2. **EA's "player" counts:** 11.3M first week / 14.5M first month for FC 24 (includes non-purchasers)
3. **Steam peak concurrent data:** FIFA 23 (110,757) > FC 25 (108,534) > FC 24 (107,109) > FC 26 (95,489)
4. **Chart positions:** All three titles dominated European sales charts during their active periods
5. **Financial results:** EA Q3 FY25 revenue $1.88B (down from $1.94B), with FC cited as a cause of decline
