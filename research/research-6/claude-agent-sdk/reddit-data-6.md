Wording with 'players' to investors is corny since game is also on EA Play and was 'free' with Geforce Now subscription"
  - Comment (16 upvotes): "EA FC25 underperforming is way more of an issue for EA then dragon age. People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore."

And Fifa 23 itself was an absolute monster so EA FC 24 is probably doing better than FIFA 22 and probably a lot of other previous entries. Just goes to show that its EA that is engraved into the people's mind at this point not FIFA which means FIFA's power play ended up being a big fail for them."

## Per-Game Sales Data Summary

---

### FIFA 23 (Released September 30, 2022 -- Active through 2023)

**Copies Sold / Player Count Data Found on Reddit:**

- **No explicit total copies sold figure found on Reddit** for FIFA 23 specifically
- FIFA 23 was described as "an absolute monster" in terms of sales (comment in r/pcgaming, Post 4)
- FIFA 23 was the fastest-selling game in Europe, making it the benchmark all other games are measured against (Post 6: "Hogwarts Legacy is Europe's fastest-selling game that isn't FIFA for a generation")
- FIFA 23 benefited enormously from the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar (November-December 2022), which boosted sales and engagement well into 2023
- EA FC 24's European launch was "10% down on FIFA 23" (Post 4 comment), meaning FIFA 23's launch was the high-water mark
- EA reported that FIFA 23 had **record engagement** during the World Cup period (widely discussed across Reddit but specific player count numbers not found in retrieved posts)
- FIFA 23 servers were shut down in September 2023 when FC 24 launched

**Estimated Sales Context:**
- Based on historical data (FIFA 13 sold 7.4 million in its first month per r/truegaming post), and FIFA 23 being described as a record-breaker boosted by the World Cup, estimated sales are likely in the range of 10-20+ million copies based on franchise trajectory. EA previously stated the FIFA franchise had over 325 million copies sold lifetime.

---

### EA Sports FC 24 (Released September 29, 2023 -- Active through 2024)

**Copies Sold / Player Count Data Found on Reddit:**

- **European launch sales were approximately 10% below FIFA 23** (Post 4, r/pcgaming comment with 2 upvotes citing VGC/GSD data)
- FC 24 was the **#1 selling game in Europe in September 2023**, beating Starfield (Post 4)
- FC 24 was the **#1 best-selling game in Germany for 2024** (physical + digital) (Post 9)
- One Reddit commenter noted FC 24 was "probably doing better than FIFA 22 and probably a lot of other previous entries" despite the 10% decline vs. FIFA 23
- FC 24 had significant enough player base to generate $30 loot box controversy during launch week (Post 11)
- FC 24 appeared in the top of European charts throughout its lifecycle

**Copies Sold Estimate:**
- No specific total copies sold figure found on Reddit. The 10% decline from FIFA 23 would suggest very strong sales regardless, given FIFA 23 was a record-breaker.

---

### EA Sports FC 25 (Released September 27, 2024 -- Active through 2025)

**Copies Sold / Player Count Data Found on Reddit:**

- **EA Sports FC 25 sold approximately 5% fewer copies than EA Sports FC 24 according to GSD (European retail tracking) data** (Post 7, r/gaming comment: "Based on GSD data, EA Sports FC 25 sold just 5% less than EA Sports FC 24")
- FC 25 underperformance was a primary driver of **EA losing $6 billion in market value** in January 2025 (Post 1)
- EA **slashed fiscal year guidance** specifically citing FC 25 underperformance alongside Dragon Age: The Veilguard (Posts 1, 2, 3)
- EA Q3 FY2025 revenue fell to **$1.88 billion** (from $1.94 billion year-over-year) due in part to FC weakness (Post 3)
- Despite "underperformance," FC 25 was still the **#1 best-selling game in Europe for H1 2025**, topping all 17 tracked European countries (Post 8)
- FC 25 was still the **#1 best-selling game in Germany for 2024** (Post 9, depending on whether data covers full year including FC 25's Sept 2024 launch)
- Community reception was very negative: "EA FC 25 is probably the least effort EA has ever put in" (Post 15, 517 upvotes)
- "EAFC deserves to have flopped they were taking the piss the last few years even more than usual" (Post 1 comment, 189 upvotes)
- The issue was described as both lower copy sales AND lower Ultimate Team (FUT) microtransaction spending: "People aren't buyin the cards as much anymore" (Post 2 comment)

**Key Financial Context:**
- EA's total FC/soccer franchise revenue is referenced as "almost 2 billion" in a post citing EA's Q3 FY25 earnings (Post 12), though this appears to be total EA company Q3 revenue, not FC-specific
- EA saved on the FIFA licensing fee (~$150M/year reportedly) but this was offset by lower sales

---

## Additional Context and Cross-References

### Franchise Trajectory
- The FIFA/EA FC franchise has been one of the **top-selling video game franchises of all time**, listed alongside Mario, Pokemon, Call of Duty, and GTA on "Best Selling Video Game Franchises Ever" charts (Post 16)
- FIFA has historically been the **#1 or #2 best-selling game annually in Europe** -- being beaten was historically notable (Post 6)
- The franchise shows a **declining trajectory** from FIFA 23 (record high) to FC 24 (down ~10%) to FC 25 (down a further ~5% from FC 24)

### Name Change Impact
- The rebrand from "FIFA" to "EA Sports FC" was announced May 2022 and took effect with FC 24 in September 2023 (Post 19)
- A 10% decline at launch was considered "not bad at all given the complete name change" (Post 4 comment)
- The FIFA organization announced plans to create a rival game with 2K Games, though no concrete product has materialized in the research period

### Revenue vs. Copies Sold
- EA does not publicly break out exact copies sold for individual titles; they report net bookings and revenue at the segment level
- The franchise's revenue comes from both **base game sales** (copies sold) and **Ultimate Team microtransactions** (NOT in scope for this research)
- Reddit discussions consistently note that the bigger concern for EA is declining engagement and spending in Ultimate Team, not just base game sales

### EA Company Acquisition
- EA was acquired for $55 billion by PIF (Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in 2025 (Post 17)
- EA Sports FC is one of EA's most valuable properties and a significant factor in the $55B valuation
