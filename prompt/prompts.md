Based on this course I want to create a project in this repo which is self-evolving. The idea of the project is that I have a research problem. The problem is you have to go over the internet and search for all the FIFA games that have been released so far till FC 26 from backwards like 1990s and list down those game list and also the revenue generated from these games. I will provide you the MCP tools of the Reddit and the Tavili Uh What This report does That Dis research problem will Be given To both Cloud Agent SDK And The Claude Code CLI For Da Claude Code CLI There Will B A Command Uh Slash Research Which Well— Use the subagents Reddit and Tableau and do a search regarding the problem. And in the end create the output file in the root folder, uh, Claude Code CLI Output.md and. Paste all the research in their directory with research one similarly, The Claude Agent SDK Uh, there will be a basic app from where there is an execute research button on the front end when Uh The button is clicked it will do a research and come up with the output and write the output in the Claude Agent SDK folder in the root directory with the research one output dot empty file So this is The Main Idea Basically. The Project Is Self-evolving In a way that uh In Order to Run The Claude Agent SDK You Will Be Needing The Claude In Chrome So I Will Also Provide The Access Now Uh By Self-evolving project what I Mean Is. After both Claude Agent SDK And Claude Code CLI Produce The Output. These Two Outputs Will Be Compared And Every Number And Every Research That Has Been Done Will Be Compared And If There Is A Difference. Of Greater Than 10% Means Both The Outputs Are Not 19% Similar They Will Again Do The Research With Minor Tweaking In Their Prompts And Uh So The System Will Be Self-evolved And Keep On Running And Keep On Testing Until Both The Outputs Are 90% Accurate In Terms Of Number And Similarity So This Is The Idea Based On The Course How Can We Execute This Idea? Come Up With A Plan!

# 3
Create Claude.md based on the plan, also write the instructions in cloud.md that whenever I provide with a new prompt, you need to add this prompt in the prompts.md file.

# 4
Regarding the plan, I have a question about the Phase-V Orchestrator Self-Evolving Loop. What is this, and how will it run both the CLI and the Agent SDK to generate the output?

# 5
You did not append my last prompt as per instructions in the claude.md

# 6
Regarding the plan, can we make this system 100% autonomous? That is, the system compares the output itself without human in the loop and uses the Ralph Wiggum Bash Loop. I am sharing you the sample repo where the RALPH WIGGUM BASH LOOP is implemented using the script. You can take a reference of that as well. What I want this system to run autonomously for days and weeks until both outputs are 90% similar. Here is the link of the repo of the rough wiggum implementation: /Users/shayanraees/Documents/Github/novel-llm-26

# 7
Yes update the plan with this new approach.
